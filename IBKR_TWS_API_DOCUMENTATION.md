title: Introduction
---
The TWS API is a TCP Socket Protocol API based on connectivity to the Trader Workstation or IB Gateway. The API acts as an interface to retrieve and send data autonomously to Interactive Brokers. Interactive Brokers provides code systems in Python, Java, C++, C#, and VisualBasic.

The TWS API is a message protocol as its core, and any library that implements the TWS API, whether created by IB or someone else, is a tool to send and receive these messages over a TCP socket connection with the IB host platform (TWS or IB Gateway). As such the system can be tweaked and modified into any language of interest given the intention to translate the underlying decoder.

In short, a library written in any other languages must be sending and receiving the same data in the same format as any other conformant TWS API library, so users can look at the documentation for our libraries to see what a given request or response consists of (what it must include, in what form, etc.) and implement them in their own structure.

Our TWS API components are aimed at experienced professional developers willing to enhance the current TWS functionality. Before you use TWS API, please make sure you fully understand the concepts of OOP ([https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-object-oriented-programming/)) and other Computer Science Concepts. Regrettably, Interactive Brokers cannot offer any programming consulting. Before contacting our API support, please always refer to our available documentation, sample applications and Recorded Webinars

This guide references the Java, VB, C#, C++ and Python Testbed sample projects to demonstrate the TWS API functionality. Code snippets are extracted from these projects and we suggest all those users new to the TWS API to get familiar with them in order to quickly understand the fundamentals of our programming interface. The Testbed sample projects can be found within the samples folder of the TWS API's installation directory.

</Steps>



---
title: OrderId
---
The Order ID is a client-managed identifier used to track, modify, and cancel orders. As a result, it must be strictly increasing. 

The [nextValidId()](/tws-api/doc/next-valid-id/) callback function receives the next valid order ID. This function is called once upon initial connection.

The [reqIds()](/tws-api/doc/next-valid-id/request-next-valid-id) function can be used to request the next valid ID, which is returned via the `nextValidId()` callback function.

<CodeBlocks>
    ```python title={"Python"}
    class TestApp(EClient, EWrapper):
        def __init__(self):
            EClient.__init__(self, self)
            self.nextOrderId = None
    
        def nextValidId(self, orderId: OrderId):
            self.nextOrderId = orderId
    
    ```

</CodeBlocks>



---
title: Placing Orders
---
Placing orders first requires a [contract](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/) to be defined. 

In the code below, the [`reqContractDetails()`](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/request-contract-details) function initiates the sequence of function calls that place an order. Inside the defined `contractDetails()` callback function below, the `placeOrder()` function is called, which places the order.

Data from the `placeOrder()` function is returned via the `openOrder()` and `orderStatus()` callback functions.

<Callout intent='note'>
    Comprehensive example code for C++, C#, Java, Python, and Visual Basic can be found in the /samples directory of the downloaded TWS API file.
</Callout>

The requested contract object is returned via the [`contractDetails()`](doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/receive-contract-details#ewrappercontractdetails-) callback function.

title: Requesting Portfolio Data
---
Requesting portfolio data requires the use of the [reqAccountUpdates()](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-updates/requesting-account-updates) function which returns data via the [updateAccountValue()](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-updates/receiving-account-updates#ewrapperupdateaccountvalue-), [updatePortfolio()](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-updates/receiving-account-updates#ewrapperupdateportfolio-), and the [updateAccountTime()](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-updates/receiving-account-updates#ewrapperupdateaccounttime-) callback functions.

The [accountDownloadEnd()](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-updates/receiving-account-updates#ewrapperaccountdownloadend-) callback function runs when all account information has been returned.

title: Requesting Market Data
---
Requesting market data first requires the definition of a contract object for which to return market data for.

The `reqMarketDataType()` function sets the market data type. The type can either be live, frozen, delayed, or delayed frozen. The differences between these types are described [here](/tws-api/doc/market-data-delayed/introduction).

The `reqMktData()` function returns data through the [tickPrice()](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/receive-live-data#ewrappertickprice-) and [tickSize()](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/receive-live-data#ewrapperticksize-) callback functions.

* Online Code Card



---
title: Introduction
---
Our programming interface is designed to automate some of the operations a user normally performs manually within the TWS Software such as placing orders, monitoring your account balance and positions, viewing an instrument's live data… etc. There is no logic within the API other than to ensure the integrity of the exchanged messages. Most validations and checks occur in the backend of TWS and our servers. Because of this it is highly convenient to familiarize with the TWS itself, in order to gain a better understanding on how our platform works. Before spending precious development time troubleshooting on the API side, it is recommended to first experiment with the TWS directly.

**Remember:** If a certain feature or operation is not available in the TWS, it will not be available on the API side either!



---
title: C# for MacOS
---
The TWS API C# source files are not available through the Mac and Unix distribution download as the language is built around Dynamic Link Library (DLL) files for execution. This is because DLL files are exclusively supported through Windows platforms.



---
title: C++ DLLs and Static Linking
---
Following the TWS API's recent migration to Protobuf, clients developing in C++ should prioritize static linking over the use of DLLs.

This recommendation is based on the Google Protobuf documentation. For more information on the reasoning behind it, or questions on enabling DLLs for use with Protobuf, please see [DLLs vs static linking](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/google/protobuf/+/HEAD/cmake/README.md#dlls-vs_static-linking).



---
title: Canadian Residents Restricted From Programmatically Trading Canadian Products
---
Interactive Brokers Canada Inc. (IBC) does not allow users to use your own trading application to electronically submit order for products traded on a Canadian exchange or other marketplace through API, which would include Third Party Integrations. This decision was made through multiple and extensive communications between IBC compliance and personnel and senior management of the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO), formerly the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC), our self-regulatory organization.

CIRO has implemented [IIROC Dealer Member Rule (DMR) 3200](https://www.ciro.ca/sites/default/files/legacy/2021-09/RulesCollated_090121_en.pdf) A. 1. (b) (i) which prohibits CIRO registrants, including IBC, from allowing its clients to use their own automated order systems to generated orders.

Unfortunately, these restrictions would be also applicable with third-party applications like TradingView, NinjaTrader, or other such groups as they use an API connection.



---
title: Paper Trading
---
If your regular trading account has been approved and funded, you can use your Account Management page to open a [Paper Trading Account](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/papertradingaccount.htm) which lets you use the full range of trading facilities in a simulated environment using real market conditions. Using a Paper Trading Account will allow you not only to get familiar with the TWS API but also to test your trading strategies without risking your capital.

Please be aware that the Paper Trading Environment relies on more simulated technologies than the Live trading environment. As a result, certain behavior such as order execution may vary

Note the paper trading environment has inherent [limitations](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/aboutpapertradingaccounts.htm).



---
title: Download TWS or IB Gateway
---
In order to use the TWS API, all customers must install either Trader Workstation or IB Gateway to connect. Both downloads maintain the same level of usage and support; however, they both have equal benefits. 

* The Trader Workstation has access all of the same information as the API, if users would like an interface to confirm data.
* IB Gateway will be less resource intensive as there is no UI.
* TWS will be locked from inactivity for IBHK users which will disconnect any API sessions. IB Gateway does not maintain this behavior.

---
title: TWS Online or Offline Version?
---
It is recommended for API users to use offline TWS because TWS online version has automatic update. Please use same TWS version to make sure the TWS version and TWS API version are synced. These will help preventing version conflict issue.

![Highlights the Offline TWS versions on the download page.](file:docs/assets/media/twsOfflineHighlight.png)



---
title: Introduction
---
The settings required to use the TWS API with the Trader Workstation are managed in the Global Configuration under "API" -> "Settings"

In this section, only the most important API settings for API connection are covered.

Please:

* Enable "ActiveX and Socket Clients"
* Disable "Read-Only API"
* Verify the "Socket Port" value

![TWS Global Configuration window displaying API Settings and the required API configuration.](file:docs/assets/media/api-settings.png)



---
title: '"Never Lock Trader Workstation" Setting'
---
Note: For IBHK API users, it is commended to use IB Gateway instead of TWS. It is because all IBHK users cannot choose "Never Lock Trader Workstation" in TWS – Global Configuration – Lock and Exit. If there is inactivity, TWS will be locked and there will be API disconnection.



---
title: Memory Allocation
---
In TWS/ IB Gateway – "Global Configuration" – "General", you can adjust the **Memory Allocation (in MB)\***.

This feature is to control how much memory your computer can assign to the TWS/ IB Gateway application. Usually, higher value allows users to have faster data returning speed.

Normally, it is recommended for API users to set 4000. However, it depends on your computer memory size because setting too high may cause High Memory Usage and application not responding.

![TWS Global Configuration window displaying General Settings and the Memory Allocation section.](file:docs/assets/media/gc-general-memory.png)

For details, please visit: [https://www.ibkrguides.com/traderworkstation/increase-tws-memory-size.htm](https://www.ibkrguides.com/traderworkstation/increase-tws-memory-size.htm)

Note:

1. In IB Gateway Global Configuration – API – settings, there is no "Compatibility Mode: Send ISLAND for US stocks trading on NASDAQ". Specifying NASDAQ exchange in contract details may cause error if connecting to IB Gateway. For this error, please specify ISLAND exchange.



---
title: Daily & Weekly Reauthentication
---
### **Daily Reauthentication**

In TWS/ IB Gateway – "Global Configuration" – "Lock and Exit", you can choose the time of your TWS being shut down.

For API users, it is recommended to choose "Never lock Trader Workstation" and "Auto restart".

![TWS Global Configuration window displaying Lock and Exit Settings.](file:docs/assets/media/Image-3-1-700x560.png)

Note:

1. IBHK users do not have "**Never lock Trader Workstation**" and "**Auto restart**" in TWS. It is suggested for IBHK users to use IB Gateway in order to have stable API connection because IB Gateway won't be locked due to inactivity. Also, IBHK users can choose "**Auto restart**" in IB Gateway.

### **Weekly Reauthentication**

The weekly authentication cycle starts on every Monday. If you receive `Login failed = Soft token=0 received instead of expected permanent for zdc1.ibllc.com:4001 (SSL)`,  this means you need to manually login again to complete the weekly reauthentication task.



---
title: Order Precautions
---
In TWS – "Global Configuration" – "API" – "Precautions", you can enable the following items to stop receiving the order submission messages.

* Enable "Bypass Order Precautions for API orders".
* Enable "Bypass Bond warning for API orders".
* Enable "Bypass negative yield to worst confirmation for API orders".
* Enable "Bypass Called Bond warning for API orders".
* Enable "Bypass "same action pair trade" warning for API orders".
* Enable "Bypass price-based volatility risk warning for API orders".
* Enable "Bypass US Stocks market data in shares warning for API orders".
* Enable "Bypass Redirect Order warning for Stock API orders".
* Enable "Bypass No Overfill Protection precaution for destinations where implied natively".

![TWS Global Configuration window displaying API Precautions.](file:docs/assets/media/api-precautions.png)



---
title: Connected IB Server Location in TWS
---
Each IB account has a pre-decided IB server. You can visit this link to know our IB servers' locations: [https://www.interactivebrokers.com/download/IB-Host-and-Ports.pdf](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/download/IB-Host-and-Ports.pdf)

Yet, all IB paper accounts are connected to US server by default and its location cannot be changed.

As IB servers in different regions have different scheduled server maintenance time ( [https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/systemStatus.php)), you may need to change the IB server location in order to avoid service downtime.

For checking your connected IB server location, you can go to TWS and click "Data" to see your Primary server. In the below image, the pre-decided IB server location is: cdc1.ibllc.com

![TWS Connections Window. ](file:docs/assets/media/market-data-farm.png)

If you want to change your live IB account server location in TWS, please submit a web ticket to "Technical Assistance" – "Connectivity" in order to request changing the IB server location.

In the web ticket, you need to provide:

1. Which account do you want to have IB server location change?
2. Which IB server location would you like to connect to?
   * TWS AMERICA – EAST (New York)
   * TWS AMERICA – CENTRAL (Chicago)
   * TWS Europe (Zurich)
   * TWS Asia (Hong Kong)
   * TWS Asia – CHINA (For mainland China users, if the account server is hosted in Hong Kong, they will automatically connect with the Shenzhen Gateway mcgw1.ibllc.com.cn)
3. Which IB scheduled maintenance time do you choose? (Recommended to choose the default schedule maintenance time of its own IB server location)
   * North America
   * Europe
   * Asia

After you submit the ticket, you will receive a web ticket reply which **require you to confirm and understand the migration request**.

Note:

1. For Internet users, as the connection between IB server and Exchange goes through a dedicated line, it is commonly recommended to choose a IB server location which is closer to your TWS location. For IB connection types, please visit: [https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/connectionInterface.php](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/software/connectionInterface.php)
2. The pre-decided IB server location connected from TWS is different from the IB Server location connected from IB Client Portal and IBKR Mobile.
   * IB server location connected from TWS is pre-decided. You can submit a web ticket to request the IB server relocation for the TWS connection.
   * IB server location connected from Client Portal or IBKR Mobile is based on your nearest IB server location. You cannot request the IB server relocation for Client Portal and IBKR Mobile connections. OAuth CP API users now cannot specify which server they want to connect to by themselves.

title: Smart Routing
---
IB SmartRoutingSM is dedicated to best price execution for our customers. And with that, Interactive Brokers offers an array of SmartRouting options to our Trader Workstation and TWS API users. Users familiar with Trader Workstation are likely already familiar with the process of [Configuring SmartRouting via Global Configuration;](https://ibkrguides.com/tws/usersguidebook/configuretws/configure%20smartrouting.htm)however, these features are available in the API as well.

The values are specifically formatted when submitted through the TWS API, and must follow the specified patterns below.

#### Available throughout TWS API

| SMART Option Algorithm | API String |
| --- | --- |
| SMART Multipurpose | "SMART" |
| SMART Dark Only | "SMART DarkOnly" |

#### Available for CAD-currency Exchanges Only

| SMART Option Algorithm | API String |
| --- | --- |
| SMART Maximize Rebate | "SMART MaxRebate" |
| SMART Maximize Fill | "SMART MaxFill" |
| SMART Prefer Rebate | "SMART PreferRebate" |
| SMART Prefer Fill | "SMART PreferFill" |
| SMART Primary Exchange | "SMART Primary" |
| SMART Highest Volume Exchange w/ Rebate | "SMART VRebate" |
| SMART Highest Volume Exchange w/ Lowest Fee | "SMART VLowFee" |

In TWS Global Configuration – Orders – Smart Routing, you can set your SMART order routing algorithm. 

![TWS Global Configuration window displaying Smart Routing.](file:docs/assets/media/smart-routing.png)



---
title: Allocation Setup (For Financial Advisors)
---
In TWS Global Configuration – Advisor Setup – Presets, you can need to choose Allocation Preference in order to avoid wrong allocation result.

![TWS Global Configuration window displaying Presets for Advisors.](file:docs/assets/media/Advisor-setup-700x524.png)



---
title: Intelligent Order Resubmission
---
The TWS Setting listed in the Global Configuration under API -> Setting for **Maintain and resubmit orders when connection is restored**, is enabled by default in TWS 10.28 and above. When this setting is checked, all orders received while connectivity is lost will be saved and automatically resubmitted when connectivity is restored. Please note, if the Trader Workstation is closed during this time, the orders are deleted regardless of the setting.

Beginning with Trader Workstation and IB Gateway 10.40, the Global Configuration -> API -> Settings will provide a new setting for "Maintain and resubmit orders when connection is restored." This setting will automatically maintain or submit any orders on the platform after a network disconnect or the [auto-restart behavior](/tws-api/doc/tws-settings/daily-weekly-reauthentication).



---
title: Per-Currency Account Value Prefix
---
When you subscribe to account data updates through the TWS API (using reqAccountUpdates or reqAccountUpdatesMulti), the system delivers two categories of data:

* Account-level values – aggregate data representing the entire account
* Per-currency values – data broken down by individual currency (ledger entries)

The key name AccruedCash exists in both categories, making it impossible for API clients to determine whether a received value represents an account-level aggregate or a single-currency entry based on the key alone.

**Setting**

Location: File – Global Configuration – API – Settings

Checkbox: Prepend "$LEDGER-" prefix to per-currency account values

Enabled (default for new users): Per-currency value keys are prefixed with $LEDGER -. Account-level keys remain unchanged.  
Disabled (default for upgrading users): All keys are delivered as-is, preserving backward compatibility with existing client implementations.

**Example**  
With the setting disabled:  
Key: "AccruedCash" Currency: "USD" Value: "1500" \< account-level  
Key: "AccruedCash" Currency: "USD" Value: "1000" \< per-currency  
Key: "AccruedCash" Currency: "EUR" Value: "500" \< per-currency

With the setting enabled:  
Key: "AccruedCash" Currency: "USD" Value: "1500" + account-level  
Key: "$LEDGER-AccruedCash" Currency: "USD" Value: "1000" \< per-currency  
Key: "$LEDGER-AccruedCash" Currency: "EUR" Value: "500" \< per-currency

**Important Notes**

* Upgrading users: The setting is disabled by default after upgrade to avoid breaking existing API client applications. Enable it once your client code is updated to handle the prefixed keys.
* Applies globally: The setting affects all connected API clients for the given TWS session.



---
title: Disconnect on Invalid Format
---
The TWS Setting listed in the Global Configuration under API -> Setting for **Maintain connection upon receiving incorrectly formatted fields**, is enabled by default in TWS 10.28 and above. For clients operating on Client Version 100 and above, users will not disconnect from fields with invalid value submissions when the setting is enabled.



---
title: TWS API Download
---
* Excel and C# are only available through the Windows installation. As a result, Excel and C# are not available for Mac or Linux users. 
* It is recommended for API users to use same TWS API version to make sure the TWS version and TWS API version are synced in order to prevent version conflict issue.
* Running the Windows version of the API installer creates a directory "C:\\TWS API\" for the API source code in addition to automatically copying two files into the Windows directory for the DDE and C++ APIs. 
* ***It is important that the API installs to the C: drive***, as otherwise API applications may not be able to find the associated files. 
* The Windows installer also copies compiled dynamic linked libraries (DLL) of the ActiveX control TWSLib.dll, C# API CSharpAPI.dll, and C++ API TwsSocketClient.dll. 
* Running the API installer is designed to install an ActiveX control TWSLib.dll, and TwsRtdServer control TwsRTDServer.dll.
* The TWS API is **only** available through the interactivebrokers.github.io MSI or ZIP file. Any other resource, including pip, NuGet, or any other online repository is not hosted, endorsed, supported, or connected to Interactive Brokers. As such, updates to the installation should always be downloaded from the github directly.

title: Introduction
---
Third party software vendors make use of the TWS' programming interface (API) to integrate their platforms with Interactive Broker's. Thanks to the TWS API, well known platforms such as Ninja Trader or Multicharts can interact with the TWS to fetch market data, place orders and/or manage account and portfolio information.

**It is important to keep in mind that most third party API platforms are not compatible with all IBKR account structures**. Always check first with the software vendor before opening a specific account type or converting an IBKR account type. For instance, many third party API platforms such as NinjaTrader and TradeNavigator are **not** compatible with IBKR linked account structures, so it is highly recommended to first check with the third party vendor before linking your IBKR accounts.

An ongoing list of common [Third Party Connections](/third-party-integrations/available-integrations) are available within our documentation. This resource will also link out to connection guides detailing how a user can connect with a given platform.

A non-exhaustive list of third party platforms implementing our interface can be found in our [Investor's Marketplace](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/Universal/servlet/MarketPlace.MarketPlaceServlet). As stated in the marketplace, the vendors' list is in no way a recommendation from Interactive Brokers. If you are interested in a given platform that is not listed, please contact the platform's vendor directly for further information.



---
title: Introduction
---
Noted in further depth through our [Architecture](/tws-api/doc/architecture/introduction) section, the TWS API is built using standardized socket protocol. As a result, users may develop or access alternative third party modules and classes in place of Interactive Brokers default modules through the [TWS API Download](/tws-api/doc/download-the-tws-api/). While the API is adaptable for client implementations, please understand that **Interactive Brokers API Support cannot provide support for non-standard implementations.** While we can review your [API logs](/tws-api/doc/troubleshooting-support/log-files/api-logs) to affirm what content is being submitted, any further assistance will need to take place with the module's original developer.

*This is neither an endorsement or admonishment of third party implementations. Interactive Brokers will always advise clients use our direct TWS API implementation whenever possible.*



---
title: ib_insync and ib_async
---
While Interactive Brokers' API Support is aware of the ib\_insync package, we [cannot provide coding assistance\](/tws-api/doc/troubleshooting-support/introduction) for the package.

With that in mind, users should be aware that the original ib\_insync package is built using a legacy release of the TWS API and is no longer updated. Users who wish to implement the ib\_insync structure using supported releases of the Trader Workstation should migrate to the [ib\_async package](https://pypi.org/project/ib_async/), which is a modernized implementation of the package by one of its original developers.

*This is neither an endorsement or admonishment of either the ib\_insync or ib\_async library. Interactive Brokers will always advise clients use our direct TWS API implementation whenever possible.*



---
title: Introduction
---
While all of the available Trader Workstation API default samples provide equivalent functionality, some languages have unique configurations that must be implemented in order to use our samples or program code with the underlying API.



---
title: Implementing the Intel Decimal Library for MacOS and Linux
---
Due to the malleability of the many Linux distributions including MacOS, Interactive Brokers is unable to provide a pre-built binary for the library. As such, users programming in C++ on a Linux machine must manually build the Intel® Decimal Floating-Point Math Library manually.

As described in the README file from the linked page, you can find the library's build steps within the ~/IntelRDFPMathLib20U2/LIBRARY/README file.

---
title: Introduction
---
Python has a unique system for importing libraries into it's IDEs. This extends even further when it comes to virtual environments. In order to utilize Python code with the TWS API, you must run our setup file in order to import the code.



---
title: 1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal
---
In order to update the Python IDE, these steps MUST be performed through Command Prompt or Terminal. This can not be done through an explorer interface.

As such, users should begin by launching their respective command line interface.

These samples will display Windows commands, though the procedure is identical on Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

![Standard command prompt window.](file:docs/assets/media/setupCmd-700x298.png)



---
title: 2. Navigate to Python Source
---
Customers should then change their directory to  `{TWS API}\source\pythonclient` .

It is then recommend to display the contents of the directory with "ls" for Unix, or "dir" for Windows users.

![Contents of python source directory.](file:docs/assets/media/setupCmdCd-700x511.png)



---
title: 3. Run The setup.py File
---
Customers will now need to run the setup.py steps with the installation parameter. This can be done with the command: `python setup.py install`

![setup.py install command.](file:docs/assets/media/setupCmdInstall.png)



---
title: 4. Confirm Updates
---
After running the prior command, users should see a large block of text describing various values being updated and added to their system. It is important to confirm that the version installed on your system mirrors the build version displayed. This example represents 10.25; however, you may have a different version.

![Updated packages from setup.py](file:docs/assets/media/setupCmdUpdate-700x346.png)



---
title: 5. Confirm your installation
---
Finally, users should look to confirm their installation. The simplest way to do this is to confirm their version with pip. Typing this command should show the latest installed version on your system: `python -m pip show ibapi`

![Result of pip command](file:docs/assets/media/setupCmdShowIbapi-700x150.png)



---
title: Protobuf UserWarning messages
---
After resolving the reference errors, using the TWSAPI may print a UserWarning upon connection. These warnings are predominantly cosmetic and can be ignored. These issues are caused by the Pypi release of protobuf running version 6.30.1 and above, while the TWS API is built with 5.29.3. The warning is simply notifying users that their version is 1 major version different. However, given protobuf is currently backgwards compatible, this should not present any issues with the implementation. Developers uncomfortable with the warning messages have a few options:

1. [Recompile Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/pythontutorial/) against their [Github 5.29.3 version](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/v5.29.3) to maintain parity with the TWS API implementations.
2. Users can also modify the code source, linked by the protobuf warning, and simply remove lines 94 and on from the runtime\_version.py file.



---
title: Implementing Visual Basic .NET
---
Our VB.NET code is provided for demonstration purposes only; there is no pure, standalone VB.NET-based TWS API library. Both our "VB\_API\_Sample" and the VB.NET "Testbed" projects included with our TWS API releases call the C# TWS API source. The provided VB.NET code only interfaces with the C# source. Please keep in mind that these samples are in VB.NET, not Visual Basic for Applications.



---
title: Introduction
---
If there are remaining questions about available API functionality after reviewing the content of this documentation, the API Support group is available to help.

-> It is important to keep in mind that IB **cannot provide programming assistance** or give suggestions on how to code custom applications. The API group can review log files which contain a record of communications between API applications and TWS, and give details about what the API can provide.

General suggestions on starting out with the IB system:

* **Become familiar with the analogous functionality in TWS before using the API**: the TWS API is nothing but a communication channel between your client application and TWS. Each API function has a corresponding tool in TWS. For instance, the market data tick types in the API correspond to watchlist columns in TWS. Any order which can be created in the API can first be created in TWS, and it is recommended to do so. Additionally, if information is not available in TWS, it will not be available in the API. Before using IB Gateway with the API, it is recommended to first become familiar with TWS.
* **Make use of the sample API applications**: the sample applications distributed with the API download have examples of essentially every API function in each of the available programming languages. If an issue does not occur in the corresponding sample application, that implies there is a problem with the custom implementation.
* **Upgrade TWS or IB Gateway periodically**: TWS and IB Gateway often have new software releases that have enhancements, and that can sometimes have bug fixes. Because of this, we strongly recommend our users to keep their software as up to date as possible. If you are experiencing a specific problem that is occurring in TWS or IB Gateway and not in the API program, it is likely resolved in the more recent software build.



---
title: Introduction
---
Log files are used by developers and support to unambiguously understand the behavior of a request.

These files are stored on the clients machine and are only sent to Interactive Brokers by client request.

These logs will recycle every 7 days. This would include the current day and the prior 6 days.



---
title: API Logs
---
TWS and IB Gateway can be configured to create a separate log file which has a record of just communications with API applications. This log is not enabled by default; but needs to be enabled by the Global Configuration setting **"Create API Message Log File"**(picture below).

* API logs contain a record of exchanged messages between API applications and TWS/IB Gateway. Since only API messages are recorded, the API logs are more compact and easier to handle. However they do not contain general diagnostic information about TWS/IBG as the TWS/IBG logs. The TWS/IBG settings folder is by default **C:\Jts** (or IBJts on Mac/Linux). The API logs are named **api.[clientId].[day].log**, where [clientId] corresponds to the Id the client application used to connect to the TWS and [day] to the week day (i.e. api.123.Thu.log).
* There is also a setting "Include Market Data in API Log" that will include streaming market data values in the API log file. Historical candlestick data is always recorded in the API log.

**Note:** Both the API and TWS logs are encrypted locally. The API logs can be decrypted for review from the associated TWS or IB Gateway session, just like the TWS logs, as shown in the section describing the Local location of logs.

**Note:** The TWS/IB Gateway log file setting has to be set to 'Detail' level before an issue occurs so that information recorded correctly when it manifests. However due to the high amount of information that will be generated under this level, the resulting logs can grow considerably in size.

**Enabling creation of API logs**

TWS:

1. Navigate to File/Edit → Global Configuration → API → Settings
2. Check the box *Create API message log file*
3. Set *Logging Level* to *Detail*
4. Click Apply and Ok

![TWS Global Configuration window displaying API settings with API logging.](file:docs/assets/media/api-settings.png)

IB Gateway:

1. Navigate to Configure → Settings → API → Settings
2. Check the box *Create API message log file*
3. Set *Logging Level* to *Detail*
4. Click Apply and Ok

![IB Gateway settings window displaying API settings with API logging.](file:docs/assets/media/api-settings-ibg.png)



---
title: How To Enable Debug Logging
---
Enabling DEBUG-level logging for the host platform (TWS or IBG, this does not affect API logs):

1. Navigate to the root TWS/IBG installation directory
2. Find jts.ini and open in text editor
3. Put debug=1 under the [Communication] section
4. Reboot TWS/IBG

Setting debug=1 has added benefits in TWS.

1. Debug=1 also allows you to enter conIds into a watchlist to resolve them into symbols. Type/paste the conId in an empty watchlist row, add |C (vertical bar, capital C) at the end, and press Enter. Example: 265598|C will resolve immediately to AAPL (exchange will be SMART where available, primary otherwise).
   * If the instrument is already present in the watchlist, nothing will happen.
2. Additional detail in the "Description" window for an instrument, normally available by right-clicking on an instrument in a watchlist and selecting Financial Instrument Info >> Description from the context menu. Debug=1 will add the conId, min order sizes, market rules (i.e., min price increments and thresholds), all available order types, and all available exchanges to this interface. Changing the behavior of TWS to bring up that Description window on double-click can make it easier to find.
   1. In TWS, go to Global Configuration >> Display >> Ticker Row
   2. Change "Double-click on Financial Instrument will" dropdown menu to "Open Contract Details"



   ---
title: Location of Interactive Brokers Logs
---
Logs are stored in the TWS settings directory, C:\Jts\ and then your user subdirectory by default on a Windows computer (the default can be configured differently on the login screen).

The path to the log file directory can be found by:

1. Log in to Trader Workstation or IB Gateway (You must use the platform your API is connecting to)
2. Press **Ctrl-Alt-U** to display the user directory window.
3. This will reveal path such as `C:\Jts\detcfsvirl\`.

Due to privacy regulations, logs are encrypted before they are saved to disk. To review them on your machine, you may need to [Export Your Logs](/tws-api/doc/troubleshooting-support/log-files/exporting-logs).



---
title: How To Delete Logs
---
In some instances, your logs may be too large to export or upload for Client Services to review. In scenarios such as this, the Support team may request that you delete your existing API logs, and then replicate the error before attempting to upload them again.

To delete your logs:

1. [Locate your Logs](/tws-api/doc/troubleshooting-support/log-files/location-of-interactive-brokers-logs).
2. Exit Trader Workstation or IB Gateway session by clicking "File" and "Exit".
3. In your window explorer, navigate to your "User Dir" found in Step (1).
4. Once in the directory, select the files labeled like "api.0.20250110.105733.ibgzenc", "tws.20250110.105733.ibgzenc" or "ibgateway.20250110.105733.ibgzenc" and press the "DEL" or "Delete" key on your keyboard.



---
title: Uploading Logs
---
If API logging has been enabled with the setting "Create API Message Log" during the time when an issue occurs, it can be uploaded to the API group.

**Important:** Please be aware that the process of uploading logs does not notify support, nor is a ticket logged. You will need to contact our representatives through a direct call, chat, or secure message center message for our representatives to be aware of the upload.

To upload logs as a Windows user:

1. In TWS or IB Gateway, press CTRL+ALT+H to bring up the Upload Diagnostics window.
2. In the "reason" text field, please type the reason for your upload.
   * Alternatively, type "ATTENTION: " and then the ticket number you are working with, or the name of your customer service representative.
3. Find the small arrow in the upper right corner, click it and select "Advanced View"
4. Make sure "Full internal state of the application" is checked
5. Make sure "Include previous days logs and settings" is unchecked, unless the error happened on a prior day.
6. Click Submit

To upload logs as a Mac and Linux user:

1. In TWS or IB Gateway, press CMD+OPT+H to bring up the Upload Diagnostics window.
2. In the "reason" text field, please type the reason for your upload.
   * Alternatively, type "ATTENTION: " and then the ticket number you are working with, or the name of your customer service representative.
3. Find the small arrow in the upper right corner, click it and select "Advanced View"
4. Make sure "Full internal state of the application" is checked
5. Make sure "Include previous days logs and settings" is unchecked, unless the error happened on a prior day.
6. Click Submit

If logs have been uploaded, please let the API Support group know by **creating a webticket** in the Message Center in Account Management (under Support) indicating the **username** of the associated TWS session. In some cases a TWS log may also be requested at the Detailed logging level. The TWS log can grow quite large and may not be uploadable by the automatic method; in this case an alternative means of upload can be found.



---
title: Exporting Logs
---
1. In TWS, navigate to Help menu >> Troubleshooting >> Diagnostics >> "API Logs" or "TWS Logs".
2. In IBG, both "API Logs" and "Gateway Logs" are accessible directly from the File menu.
3. Click "Export Today Logs…" to decrypt the logs and save them in plaintext (logs are stored encrypted on your local machine)



---
title: Reading Exported Logs
---
Each supported API language of the API contains a message file that translates a given number identifier into their corresponding request. The message identifier numbers used in the underlying wire protocol is the core of the TWS API.

The information on the right documents where each message reader file is located. The \{TWS API\} listed is the path to the primary TWS API or JTS folder created from the API installation.

By default, this will be saved directly on the C: drive.

Both the Incoming and Outgoing message IDs are listed in one file.

\{TWS API\}\source\pythonclient\ibapi\messages.py

Incoming Message IDs:  
\{TWS API\}\source\JavaClient\com\ib\client\EDecoder.java

Outgoing Message IDs:  
\{TWS API\}\source\JavaClient\com\ib\client\EClient.java

Incoming Message IDs:  
\{TWS API\}\source\CppClient\client\EDecoder.h

Outgoing Message IDs:  
\{TWS API\}\source\CppClient\client\EClient.h

Incoming Message IDs:  
\{TWS API\}\source\CSharpClient\client\IncomingMessage.cs

Outgoing Message IDs:  
\{TWS API\}\source\CSharpClient\client\OutgoingMessages.cs

Depending on the Excel structure used, either C# or Java file path will be used.

For ActiveX and RTD, see C#

For DDE, see Java.

In our API logs, the direction of the message is indicated by the arrow at the beginning:

**->** for incoming messages (TWS to client)

**\<-** for outgoing messages (client to TWS)

Thus  **\<- 3** (outgoing request of type 3) is a placeOrder request, and the subsequent incoming requests are:

**-> 5**= openOrder response

**-> 11**= executionData response

**-> 59**= commissionReport response

Also note that the first openOrder response carries with it an orderStatus response in the same message. If that status were to change later, it would be delivered as a standalone message:

**-> 3**= orderStatus response

title: Unset Values
---
Developers may often find a super-massive value returned from requests like market data, P&L information, and elsewhere. These are known as Unset values. Unset values are used throughout programming systems to indicate that a value is not available. Unset values are used in place of NULL characters to prevent any unexpected error be thrown in your code. Unset values are also used in place of values like 0 to avoid confusing viewers to believe they have an account balance of 0, or that an equity is worth $0.

An unset value is the maximum value of a given data type. So the Unset Double value will appear like 1.7976931348623157E308, which contains approximately 308 digits to intentionally appear extraneous.

title: Introduction

The TWS API is a BSD implementation that communicates request and response values across TCP socket using a end-line-delimited message protocol. While the underlying structure of the message will vary by request, requests typically follow a patter of indicating a message identifier, request identifier, and then directly relevant content for the request such as contract details or market data parameters.

The provided TWS API package use two distinct classes to accommodate the request / response functionality of the socket protocol, EClient and EWrapper respectively.

The EWrapper class is used to receive all messages from the host and distribute them amongst the affiliated response functions. The EReader class will retrieve the messages from the socket connection and decode them for distribution by the EWrapper class.

EClient or EClientSocket is used to send requests to the Trader Workstation. This client class contains all the available methods to communicate with the host. Up to 32 clients can be connected to a single instance of the host Trader Workstation or IB Gateway simultaneously.

The primary distinction in EClient and EClientSocket is the involvement of the EReader Class to trigger when requests should be processed. EClient is unique to the Python implementation and utilizes the Python Queue module in place of the EReaderSignal directly. Both the EReaderSignal and Python Queue module handle the queueing process for submitting messages across the socket connection. In either scenario, the EWrapper class must be implemented first to acknowledge the EClient requests.

title: Introduction

Our market maker-designed IBKR Trader Workstation (TWS) lets traders, investors, and institutions trade stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds, and funds on over 100 markets worldwide from a single account. The TWS API is a programming interface to TWS, and as such, for an application to connect to the API there must first be a running instance of TWS or IB Gateway.



---
title: The IB Gateway
---
As an alternative to TWS for API users, IBKR also offers IB Gateway (IBGW). From the perspective of an API application, IB Gateway and TWS are identical; both represent a server to which an API client application can open a socket connection after the user has authenticated. With either application (TWS or IBGW), the user must manually enter their username and password into a login window. For security reasons, a headless session of TWS or IBGW without a GUI is not supported. From the user's perspective, IB Gateway may be advantageous because it is a lighter application which consumes about 40% fewer resources.

Both TWS and IBGW were designed to be restarted daily. This is necessary to perform functions such as re-downloading contract definitions in cases where contracts have been changed or new contracts have been added. Beginning in version 974+ both applications offer an autorestart feature that allows the application to restart daily without user intervention. With this option enabled, TWS or IBGW can potentially run from Sunday to Sunday without re-authenticating. After the nightly server reset on Saturday night it will be necessary to again enter security credentials.

The advantages of TWS over IBGW is that it provides the end user with many tools (Risk Navigator, OptionTrader, BookTrader, etc) and a graphical user interface which can be used to monitor an account or place orders. For beginning API users, it is recommended to first become acquainted with TWS before using IBGW.

**For simplicity, this guide will mostly refer to the TWS although the reader should understand that for the TWS API's purposes, TWS and IB Gateway are synonymous.**



---
title: Introduction
---
Pacing Limitations with regards to the TWS API are based on the number of requests submitted by a client connection. A "request" is a user-submitted query to retrieve some form of data.

An example of a request is a query to retrieve [live watchlist data\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data). While you may make a single request for market data, you will receive market data until the subscription is cancelled or your session is disconnected. Only the original request to begin the flow of data will contribute to the pacing limitation.

The maximum number of API requests that can be submitted are equivalent to your [Maximum Market Data Lines] divided by 2, per second.

By default, all users maintain 100 market data lines. Therefore, users have a pacing limitation of (100/2)= **50 requests per second**.

Clients that have increased their market data lines to 200, by way of commission or [Quote Booster Subscription], would receive (200/2)= 100 requests per second, and this would increment as your market data lines increase or decrease.

In some use cases, if you plan to send more than 50 requests per second, some orders may be queued and delayed. For this scenario, please consider switching to FIX API.

For FIX API users in IB Gateway, the limitation is 250 messages per second.

For FIX API users without using IB Gateway or TWS, there is no limitation on messages per second, but less is better.



---
title: Pacing Behavior
---
The TWS API supports two formats for users who break the pacing limitations. This behavior is set in the Global Configuration of Trader Workstation or IB Gateway. Under "API" and then "Settings" users will see a setting for "Reject messages above maximum allowed message rate vs applying pacing."

1. If the setting is checked, TWS will notify the user they surpassed the pacing limit using error code 100. If the pacing limits are broken 3 times, the API session will terminate and the user will receive WinError 10053 on Windows or a BrokenPipe error on MacOS or Linux machines.
2. If the setting is unchecked, TWS will automatically pace the requests submitted by the user. The system will wait to acknowledge requests in the EReader Thread prior to moving on to new requests.

![Highlighting the pacing limit reject described in the previous paragraph.](file:docs/assets/media/pacing_reject.png)



---
title: Introduction
---
A socket connection between the API client application and TWS is established with the IBApi.EClientSocket.eConnect function. TWS acts as a server to receive requests from the API application (the client) and responds by taking appropriate actions. The first step is for the API client to initiate a connection to TWS on a socket port where TWS is already listening. It is possible to have multiple TWS instances running on the same computer if each is configured with a different API socket port number. Also, each TWS session can receive up to 32 different client applications simultaneously. The client ID field specified in the API connection is used to distinguish different API clients.



---
title: Establishing an API connection
---
Once our two main objects have been created, EWrapper and ESocketClient, the client application can connect via the IBApi.EClientSocket object:

    m_client.eConnect("127.0.0.1", 7497, 2);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="C++" language="cpp">
    ```cpp
    bool bRes = m_pClient->eConnect( host, port, clientId, m_extraAuth);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="C#" language="csharp">
    ```csharp
    clientSocket.eConnect("127.0.0.1", 7497, 0);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="VB.NET" language="vbnet">
    ```vbnet
    socketClient.eConnect("127.0.0.1", 7497, 0)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

eConnect starts by requesting from the operating system that a TCP socket be opened to the specified IP address and socket port. If the socket cannot be opened, the operating system (not TWS) returns an error which is received by the API client as error code 502 to IBApi.EWrapper.error (Note: since this error is not generated by TWS it is not captured in TWS log files). Most commonly error 502 will indicate that TWS is not running with the API enabled, or it is listening for connections on a different socket port. If connecting across a network, the error can also occur if there is a firewall or antivirus program blocking connections, or if the router's IP address is not listed in the "Trusted IPs" in TWS.

After the socket has been opened, there must be an initial handshake in which information is exchanged about the supported version of the TWS and API to ensure each platform can interpret received messages correctly.

* For this reason it is important that the main EReader object is not created until after a connection has been established. The initial connection results in a negotiated common version between TWS and the API client which will be needed by the EReader thread in interpreting subsequent messages.

After the highest version number which can be used for communication is established, TWS will return certain pieces of data that correspond specifically to the logged-in TWS user's session. This includes (1) the account number(s) accessible in this TWS session, (2) the next valid order identifier (ID), and (3) the time of connection. In the most common mode of operation the EClient.AsyncEConnect field is set to false and the initial handshake is taken to completion immediately after the socket connection is established. TWS will then immediately provides the API client with this information.

* Important: The **IBApi.EWrapper.nextValidID** callback is commonly used to indicate that the connection is completed and other messages can be sent from the API client to TWS. There is the possibility that function calls made prior to this time could be dropped by TWS.

There is an alternative, deprecated mode of connection used in special cases in which the variable AsyncEconnect is set to true, and the call to startAPI is only called from the connectAck() function. All IB samples use the mode AsyncEconnect = False.

The ConnectAck function is called automatically once a connection has been established with the Trader Workstation or IB Gateway.

A user can verify whether their API session is connected at any point with the EClient.isConnected() function.

title: Introduction
---
API programs always have at least two threads of execution. One thread is used for sending messages to TWS, and another thread is used for reading returned messages. The second thread uses the API EReader class to read from the socket and add messages to a queue. Everytime a new message is added to the message queue, a notification flag is triggered to let other threads know that there is a message waiting to be processed. In the two-thread design of an API program, the message queue is also processed by the first thread. In a three-thread design, an additional thread is created to perform this task. The thread responsible for the message queue will decode messages and invoke the appropriate functions in EWrapper. The two-threaded design is used in the IB Python sample Program.py and the C++ sample TestCppClient, while the 'Testbed' samples in the other languages use a three-threaded design. Commonly in a Python asynchronous network application, the asyncio module will be used to create a more sequential looking code design.

The class which has functionality for reading and parsing raw messages from TWS is the IBApi.EReader class.



---
title: C++, C#, and Java Implementations
---
For C#, Java, C++, and Visual Basic, we instead maintain a triple thread structure which requires the creation of a reader thread, a queue thread, and then a wrapper thread. The documentation listed here further elaborates on the structure for those languages.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Java" language="java">
    ```java
    final EReader reader = new EReader(m_client, m_signal); 

    reader.start();

        while (m_client.isConnected()) {
            m_signal.waitForSignal();
            try {
                 reader.processMsgs();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("Exception: "+e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }).start();
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python" language="python">
    ```python
    m_pReader = std::unique_ptr<EReader>( new EReader(m_pClient, &m_osSignal) );

    new Thread(() => { while (clientSocket.IsConnected()) { readerSignal.waitForSignal(); reader.processMsgs(); } }) { IsBackground = true }.Start();

            reader.processMsgs()
        End While
    End Sub
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Now it is time to revisit the role of IBApi.EReaderSignal initially introduced in The EClientSocket Class. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, after the EReader thread places a message in the queue, a notification is issued to make known that a message is ready for processing. In the (C++, C#/.NET, Java) APIs, this is done via the IBApi.EReaderSignal object we initiated within the IBApi.EWrapper's implementer.



---
title: Python Implementation
---
In Python IB API, the EReader logic is handled in the EClient.connect so the EReader thread is automatically started upon connection. There is **no need** for user to start the reader.

Once the client is connected, a reader thread will be automatically created to handle incoming messages and put the messages into a message queue for further process. User **is required** to trigger Client::run() below, where the message queue is processed in an infinite loop and the EWrapper call-back functions are automatically triggered.

Now it is time to revisit the role of IBApi.EReaderSignal initially introduced in The EClientSocket Class. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, after the EReader thread places a message in the queue, a notification is issued to make known that a message is ready for processing. In the Python API, this is handled automatically by the Queue class.



---
title: Remote TWS API Connections with Trader Workstation
---
If you want to connect TWS/ IB Gateway from a remote server, uncheck the "Allow connection from localhost only" setting. Under the "Trusted IPs" section, click "Create" and enter the IP Address detected in "Accept incoming connection attempt from \<IP Address>" into "Trusted IPs".

"Trusted IPs" does not accept subnet (e.g. /27, /28). It only accepts single IP Addresses. Assuming a remote computing cluster /27 which has 32 IP Addresses, a remote computing cluster will randomly assign one of the computing nodes to connect to TWS in every connection.  To make this happen, every Private IPv4 Address of the subnet must be put into the "Trusted IPs" (You can also exclude the first IP Network Address and the last IP Broadcast Address of the subnet).



---
title: Accepting an API connection from TWS
---
For security reasons, by default the API is not configured to automatically accept connection requests from API applications. After a connection attempt, a dialogue will appear in TWS asking the user to manually confirm that a connection can be made:

Untrusted IPs attempting to make a connection will be denied without prompting.

![Confirmation dialogue to confirm connection attempt.](file:docs/assets/media/api_incoming_connection.png)

To prevent the TWS from asking the end user to accept the connection, it is possible to configure it to automatically accept the connection from a trusted IP address and/or the local machine. This can easily be done via the TWS API settings:

![TWS API settings with localhost and trust IP section.](file:docs/assets/media/api_localhost_connections-700x476.png)



---
title: Logging into multiple applications
---
It is not possible to login to multiple trading applications simultaneously with the same username. However, it is possible to create additional usernames for an account that can be used in different trading applications simultaneously, as long as there is not more than a single trading application logged in with a given username at a time. There are some additional cases in which it is also useful to create additional usernames:

* If TWS or IBGW is logged in with a username that is used to login to Client Portal during that session, that application will not be able to automatically reconnect to the server after the next disconnection (such as the server reset).
* A TWS or IBGW session logged into a paper trading account will not to receive market data if it is sharing data from a live user which is used to login to Client Portal.

If a different username is utilized to login to Client Portal in either of these cases, then it will not affect the TWS/IBGW session.

[How to add additional usernames in Account Management](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/uar/addingauser.htm)

* It is important to note that market data subscriptions are setup independently for each live username.



---
title: Broken API socket connection
---
If there is a problem with the socket connection between TWS and the API client, for instance if TWS suddenly closes, this will trigger an exception in the EReader thread which is reading from the socket. This exception will also occur if an API client attempts to connect with a client ID that is already in use.

The socket EOF is handled slightly differently in different API languages. For instance in Java, it is caught and sent to the client application to IBApi::EWrapper::error with errorCode 507: "Bad Message". In C# it is caught and sent to IBApi::EWrapper::error with errorCode -1. The client application needs to handle this error message and use it to indicate that an exception has been thrown in the socket connection.

Clients can validate a broken connection with the EWrapper.connectionClosed and EClient.isConnected functions.

Once a connection fails for any reason, the EWrapper.connectionClosed function will be called. This function can be used to build reconnection logic or affirm a system disconnect.

title: Introduction
---
With the release of TWS API 10.40, Interactive Brokers has introduced the Synchronous API Wrapper class. This class provides a synchronous API structure, combining the functionality of EClient and EWrapper into a beginner-friendly interface.

The current release is still in a Beta state, slowly rolling out only a portion of what is available in the larger Trader Workstation API configuration. The interface is exclusively available through the *Python* programming language.

The content shown here is an example of what the Sync Wrapper structure looks like. A larger example of all current functionality is available in the 10.40 release of the TWS API under `{TWS API}/samples/Python/Testbed/sync_test.py` .

title: TWSSyncWrapper Class
---
The TWSSyncWrapper class is produced from the ibapi/sync\_wrapper file. Clients looking to utilize the class may seek to replace their typical imports for ibapi/client and ibapi/wrapper with an import for "from ibapi.sync\_wrapper import TWSSyncWrapper".

The TWSSyncWrapper class accepts a single argument, timeout. This will provide a default timeout integer in seconds for all connected functions to work with. If no timeout is specified, a default value of 30 seconds is passed instead.

Each function supports a timeout argument for unique endpoint timeout behavior.

```
from ibapi.sync_wrapper import TWSSyncWrapper

app = TWSSyncWrapper(timeout=30)
```



---
title: Connect & Start Connection
---
After creating the class object reference with sync wrapper, connect\_and\_start() must be used to connect the Python program with the active Trader Workstation implementation. Identical to EClient's connect() function, connect\_and\_start() supports arguments for host, port, and client\_id.

#### connect\_and\_start(

**host:** String. Determine the connecting host IP for the API to connect to. Connections on the same computer should use "localhost" or "127.0.0.1".

**port:** Integer. Determine the connecting port number configured in the Global Configuration in the "Socket Port" field.

Defaults: \{TWS Live: 7496; TWS Paper: 7497; IBG Live: 4001; IBG Paper: 4002′\}

**client\_id:** Integer. Determine the connecting client ID. TWS Supports up to 32 simultaneous API connections.

Users should connect with a client\_id of 0 for [optimal order management functionality\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/client-id-0-and-the-master-client-id).

#### )

```
app.connect_and_start(host="127.0.0.1", port=7496, client_id=0)
```

#### Response Object

While it is not necessary to handle the response from connect\_and\_start(), the function will return the result of EClient.isConnected() to help with connection validation.

The function call will return a single Boolean value, True or False, in reference to the connection status at the time of reference.

Developers may look to implement code such as this that will gracefully handle the connection procedure should it fail to connect rather than proceeding with the rest of the code implementation.

```
# Connect to TWS
# If the connection succeeded, notify the user.
# If the connection fails and False is returned, notify the user and gracefully exit the application.
if not app.connect_and_start(host="127.0.0.1", port=7496, client_id=0):
    print("Failed to connect to TWS")
    exit(1)
else:
    print("Connected to TWS")
```



---
title: Disconnect & Stop Connection
---
Once a connection is no longer needed, developers should disconnect the session. This will terminate all ongoing requests through the class's client\_id. Connections through any other client ID or port will be unaffected.

#### disconnect\_and\_stop() ``` app.disconnect_and_stop() ``` The function call does not return after calling. As a result, None is automatically passed in the event the function is referenced.



---
title: Current Time
---
Whenever a user would need to verify the current time used within Trader Workstation or to verify the connection with the application, users may call the get\_current\_time() function.

#### get\_current\_time(

**timeout:** Integer. Timeout before the request disconnects. Function-specific timeout default of 1 second.

)

```
app.get_current_time()
```

#### Response Object

get\_current\_time() will return the current timestamp as an integer representing an epoch timestamp.

```
1760478515
```



---
title: Next Valid ID
---
Requests should utilize an unique identifier after each request is submitted.

The same order identifier cannot be reused except to modify an existing order.

#### get\_next\_valid\_id(

**timeout:** Integer. Uses default timeout value passed to TWSSyncClass.

#### )

```
app.get_next_valid_id()
```

#### Response Object

Requests to the get\_next\_valid\_id() function will return the next valid order ID, which may be used in order submission.

```
123456789
```



---
title: Account Summary
---
The get\_account\_summary() function returns all relevant account details identical to Trader Workstation's "Account" window. Users may query to receive all available data or a narrow window based on the [Account Summary Tag\](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-summary/account-summary-tags).

#### get\_account\_summary(

**tags:** String. Account summary key value to receive data for. See [Account Summary Tags\](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-summary/account-summary-tags) for details.

**group:** String. Indicates a Financial Advisor's allocation group to reference account details for. Non-advisor account structures should always pass "All".

Default value passed, "All".

**timeout:** Integer. Timeout before the request disconnects. Function-specific timeout default of 5 second.

#### )

```
from ibapi.account_summary_tags import AccountSummaryTags

app.get_account_summary(AccountSummaryTags.AllTags, "All")
```

Total size of the request may vary depending on number of accounts held in the account, and the number of tags requested.

#### Response Object

**\{AccountId\}:** Dictionary. Contains all tag value pairs for the designated accountId.

\{

**\{Tag\}:** Dictionary. Contains the value of the affiliated tag along with the relevant currency.

**value:** String. Contains the alphanumeric value affiliated with the designated tag.

**currency:** String. Returns the currency used to denote the value. May return an empty string if returning value does not contain a price.

\}

---
title: Contract Details
---
Interactive Brokers trading is centered around [Contract Objects\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/the-contract-object). This is used when submitting requests for market data, retrieving position information, and placing orders. The Synchronous Wrapper utilizes the same [Contract Object\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/the-contract-object) as the standard TWS API.

Passing as much known information through a Contract Details will return all contracts that match the requesting information. At a minimum, the Contract ID, or Symbol and Security Type must be passed for contract discovery.

#### get\_contract\_details(

**contract:** [Contract Object\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/the-contract-object). Contract details you are searching for.

**timeout:** Integer. Timeout before the request disconnects. Function-specific timeout default of 5 second.

#### )

```
contract = Contract()
contract.symbol = "AAPL"
contract.secType = "STK"

app.get_contract_details(contract=contract)
```

#### Response Object

The get\_contract\_details() function will return a list of [Contract\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/the-contract-object) objects.  
Unless a relatively narrow scope is provided during the initial contract details request, multiple contract objects may be returned within the list. Please be aware that directly printing this information may result in the memory address being displayed.

title: Introduction
---
The IBApi.EClient.reqAccountSummary method creates a subscription for the account data displayed in the TWS Account Summary window. It is commonly used with multiple-account structures. Introducing broker (IBroker) accounts with more than 50 subaccounts or configured for on-demand account lookup cannot use reqAccountSummary with group="All". A profile name can be accepted in place of group. See Unification of Groups and Profiles.

The TWS offers a comprehensive overview of your account and portfolio through its Account and Portfolio windows. This information can be obtained via the TWS API through three different kind of requests/operations.



---
title: Introduction
---
The initial invocation of reqAccountSummary will result in a list of all requested values being returned, and then every three minutes those values which have changed will be returned. The update frequency of 3 minutes is the same as the TWS Account Window and cannot be changed.



---
title: Requesting Account Summary
---
Requests a specific account's summary. This method will subscribe to the account summary as presented in the TWS' Account Summary tab. Customers can specify the data received by using a specific tags value. See the Account Summary Tags section for available options.

Alternatively, many languages offer the import of AccountSummaryTags with a method to retrieve all tag values.

#### EClient.reqAccountSummary (

**reqId:** int. The unique request identifier.

**group:** String. set to "All" to return account summary data for all accounts, or set to a specific Advisor Account Group name that has already been created in TWS Global Configuration.

**tags:** String. A comma separated list with the [desired tags](#account-summary-tags)

)

**Important:** only **two** active summary subscriptions are allowed at a time!

title: Cancel Account Summary

Once the subscription to account summary is no longer needed, it can be cancelled via the IBApi::EClient::cancelAccountSummary method:

#### EClient.cancelAccountSummary (

**reqId:** int. The identifier of the previously performed account request

)

<Tabs>

    m_pClient->cancelAccountSummary(9001);
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



---
title: Introduction
---
The IBApi.EClient.reqAccountUpdates function creates a subscription to the TWS through which account and portfolio information is delivered. This information is the exact same as the one displayed within the TWS' Account Window. Just as with the TWS' Account Window, unless there is a position change this information is updated at a fixed interval of three minutes.

Unrealized and Realized P&L is sent to the API function IBApi.EWrapper.updateAccountValue function after a subscription request is made with IBApi.EClient.reqAccountUpdates. This information corresponds to the data in the TWS Account Window, and has a different source of information, a different update frequency, and different reset schedule than PnL data in the TWS Portfolio Window and associated API functions (below). In particular, the unrealized P&L information shown in the TWS Account Window which is sent to [EWrapper.updatePortfolio\](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-updates/receiving-account-updates) will update either (1) when a trade for that particular instrument occurs or (2) every 3 minutes. The realized P&L data in the TWS Account Window is reset to 0 once per day.

It is important to keep in mind that the P&L data shown in the Account Window and Portfolio Window will sometimes differ because there is a different source of information and a different reset schedule.

See [Profit & Loss](#pnl) for alternative PnL data



---
title: Requesting Account Updates
---
Subscribes to a specific account's information and portfolio. Through this method, a single account's subscription can be started/stopped. As a result from the subscription, the account's information, portfolio and last update time will be received at EWrapper.updateAccountValue, EWrapper.updatePortfolio, EWrapper.updateAccountTime respectively. All account values and positions will be returned initially, and then there will only be updates when there is a change in a position, or to an account value every 3 minutes if it has changed. Only one account can be subscribed at a time. A second subscription request for another account when the previous one is still active will cause the first one to be canceled in favor of the second one.

#### EClient.reqAccountUpdates (

**subscribe:** bool. Set to true to start the subscription and to false to stop it.

**acctCode:** String. The account id (i.e. U123456) for which the information is requested.

Receives the subscribed account's information. Only one account can be subscribed at a time. After the initial callback to updateAccountValue, callbacks only occur for values which have changed. This occurs at the time of a position change, or every 3 minutes at most. This frequency cannot be adjusted.

**Note:** An important key passed back in EWrapper.updateAccountValue after a call to EClient.reqAccountUpdates is a boolean value 'accountReady'. If an accountReady value of false is returned that means that the IB server is in the process of resetting at that moment, i.e. the account is 'not ready'. When this occurs subsequent key values returned to EWrapper.updateAccountValue in the current update can be out of date or incorrect.

title: Cancel Account Updates
---
Once the subscription to account updates is no longer needed, it can be cancelled by invoking the IBApi.EClient.reqAccountUpdates method while specifying the susbcription flag to be False.

**Important:** only one account at a time can be subscribed at a time. Attempting a second subscription without previously cancelling an active one will not yield any error message although it will override the already subscribed account with the new one. With Financial Advisory (FA) account structures there is an alternative way of specifying the account code such that information is returned for 'All' sub accounts- this is done by appending the letter 'A' to the end of the account number, i.e. reqAccountUpdates(true, "F123456A")

#### EClient.reqAccountUpdates (

**subscribe:** bool. Set to true to start the subscription and to false to stop it.

**acctCode:** String. The account id (i.e. U123456) for which the information is requested.

title: Introduction

It is possible to determine from the API whether an account exists under an account family, and find the family code using the function reqFamilyCodes.

For instance, if individual account U112233 is under a financial advisor with account number F445566, if the function reqFamilyCodes is invoked for the user of account U112233, the family code "F445566A" will be returned, indicating that it belongs within that account family.

title: Introduction
---
A limitation of the function IBApi.EClient.reqAccountUpdates is that it can only be used with a single account at a time. To create a subscription for position updates from multiple accounts, the function IBApi.EClient.reqPositions is available.

**Note:** The reqPositions function is not available in Introducing Broker or Financial Advisor master accounts that have very large numbers of subaccounts (> 50) to optimize the performance of TWS/IB Gateway. Instead the function reqPositionsMulti can be used to subscribe to updates from individual subaccounts. Also not available with IBroker accounts configured for on-demand account lookup.

After initially invoking reqPositions, information about all positions in all associated accounts will be returned, followed by the IBApi::EWrapper::positionEnd callback. Thereafter, when a position has changed an update will be returned to the IBApi::EWrapper::position function. To cancel a reqPositions subscription, invoke IBApi::EClient::cancelPositions.

The function IBApi.EClient.reqPositionsMulti can be used with any account structure to subscribe to positions updates for multiple accounts and/or models. The account and model parameters are optional if there are not multiple accounts or models available. It is more efficient to use this function for a specific subset of accounts than using IBApi.EClient.reqPositions. A profile name can be accepted in place of group in the account parameter.

title: Introduction

Requests can be made to receive real time updates about the daily P&L and unrealized P&L for an account, or for individual positions. Financial Advisors can also request P&L figures for 'All' subaccounts, or for a portfolio model. This is further extended to include realized P&L information at the account or individual position level.

The P&L API functions demonstrated below return the data which is displayed in the TWS Portfolio Window in current versions of TWS. As such, the P&L values are calculated based on the reset schedule specified in TWS Global Configuration (by default an instrument-specific reset schedule) and this setting affects values sent to the associated API functions as well. Also in TWS, P&L data from virtual forex positions will be included in the account P&L if and only if the Virtual Fx section of the Account Window is expanded.

See [Account Updates](#account-updates) for alternative PnL data.



---
title: Request P&L for individual positions
---
Subscribe using the IBApi::EClient::reqPnLSingle function Cannot be used with IBroker accounts configured for on-demand lookup with account = 'All'. Currently updates are returned to IBApi.EWrapper.pnlSingle approximately once per second\*.

* If a P&L subscription request is made for an invalid conId or contract not in the account, there will not be a response.
* As elsewhere in the API, a max double value will indicate an 'unset' value. This corresponds to an empty cell in TWS.
* Introducing broker accounts without a large number of subaccounts (\<50) can receive aggregate data by specifying the account as "All".
* \*Cannot be used with IBroker accounts configured for on-demand lookup with account = 'All'

\*subject to change in the future.

#### EClient.reqPnLSingle (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier for to track the data.

title: Introduction

An IBApi.Contract object represents trading instruments such as a stocks, futures or options. Every time a new request that requires a contract (i.e. market data, order placing, etc.) is sent to TWS, the platform will try to match the provided contract object with a single candidate.



---
title: The Contract Object
---
The Contract object is an object used throughout the TWS API to define the target of your requests. Contract objects will be used for market data, portfolios, orders, executions, and even some news request. This is the staple structure used for all of the TWS API.

In all contracts, the minimum viable structure requires at least a conId and exchange; or a symbol, secType, exchange, primaryExchange, and currency. Derivatives will require additional fields, such as lastTradeDateOrExpiration, tradingClass, multiplier, strikes, and so on.

The values to the right represent the most common Contract values to pass for complete contracts. For a more comprehensive list of contract structures, please see [the Contracts page](/contracts/introduction).

#### Contract()

**ConId:** int. Identifier to specify an exact contract.

**Symbol:** String. Ticker symbol of the underlying instrument.

**SecType:** String. Security type of the traded instrument.

**Exchange:** String. Exchange for which data or trades should be routed.

**PrimaryExchange:** String. Primary listing exchange of the instrument.

**Currency:** String. Base currency the instrument is traded on.

**LastTradeDateOrContractMonth:** String. For derivatives, the expiration date of the contract.

**Strike:** double. For derivatives, the strike price of the instrument.

**Right:** String. For derivatives, the right (P/C) of the instrument.

**TradingClass:** String. For derivatives, the trading class of the instrument.  
May be used to indicate between a monthly or a weekly contract.

Given additional structures for contracts are ever evolving, it is recommended to review the relevant Contract class in your programming language for a comprehensive review of what fields are available.

title: Finding Contract Details in Trader Workstation
---
If there is more than one contract matching the same description, TWS will return an error notifying you there is an ambiguity. In these cases the TWS needs further information to narrow down the list of contracts matching the provided description to a single element.

The best way of finding a contract's description is within TWS itself. Within TWS, you can easily check a contract's description either by double clicking it or through the Financial Instrument Info -> Description menu, which you access by right-clicking a contract in TWS:

![Right click menu containing Financial Instrument Info.](file:docs/assets/media/financial_instr-description.png)

The description will then appear:

Note: you can see the extended contract details by choosing Contract Info -> Details. This option will open a web page showing all available information on the contract.

![Contract Description Window](file:docs/assets/media/contract_description.png)

Whenever a contract description is provided via the TWS API, the TWS will try to match the given description to a single contract. This mechanism allows for great flexibility since it gives the possibility to define the same contract in multiple ways.

The simplest way to define a contract is by providing its symbol, security type, currency, exchange, and primary exchange. The vast majority of stocks, CFDs, Indexes or FX pairs can be uniquely defined through these four attributes. More complex contracts such as options and futures require some extra information due to their nature. Below are several examples for different types of instruments.



---
title: Introduction
---
Complete details about a contract in IB's database can be retrieved using the function [IBApi.EClient.reqContractDetails](#request-contract-details). This includes information about a contract's conID, symbol, local symbol, currency, etc. which is returned in a IBApi.ContractDetails object. reqContractDetails takes as an argument a Contract object which may uniquely match one contract, and unlike other API functions it can also take a Contract object which matches multiple contracts in IB's database. When there are multiple matches, they will each be returned individually to the function [IBApi::EWrapper::contractDetails.](#receive-contract-details)

Request for Bond details will be returned to [IBApi::EWrapper::bondContractDetails](#receive-bond-details) instead. Because of bond market data license restrictions, there are only a few available fields to be returned in a bond contract description, namely the minTick, exchange, and short name.

Notes:

* Invoking reqContractDetails with a Contract object which has currency = USD will only return US contracts, even if there are non-US instruments which have the USD currency.
* Derivative contract requests are internally paced. Attempts to query Options, Warrants, or Futures Options must contain their maximum level of detail such as Symbol, SecType, Exchange, Currency, Strike, Right, LastTradeDateOrExpiration, and potentially TradingClass.  

  Another function of IBApi::EClient::reqContractDetails is to request the trading schedule of an instrument via the TradingHours and LiquidHours fields. The corresponding timeZoneId field will then indicate the time zone for the trading schedule of the instrument. TWS sends these timeZoneId strings to the API from the schedule responses as-is, and may not exactly match the time zones displayed in the TWS contract description.

  Possible timeZoneId values are:

  + Europe/Riga
  + Australia/NSW
  + Europe/Warsaw
  + US/Pacific
  + Europe/Tallinn
  + Japan
  + US/Eastern
  + Europe/London
  + Africa/Johannesburg
  + Israel
  + Europe/Vilnius
  + MET
  + Europe/Helsinki
  + US/Central
  + Europe/Budapest
  + Asia/Calcutta
  + Hongkong
  + Europe/Moscow
  + GMT

title: Request Contract Details
---
#### EClient.reqContractDetails (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier to track data.

**contract:** ContractDetails. the contract used as sample to query the available contracts.  
Typically contains at least the Symbol, SecType, Exchange, and Currency.  
)

Upon requesting EClient.reqContractDetails, all contracts matching the requested [Contract Object] will be returned to [EWrapper.contractDetails](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/request-contract-details) or [EWrapper.bondContractDetails\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/receive-bond-details).

When reqContractDetails is called for STK using symbol security type, exchange, and currency, TWS caches the contract data internally. Future order submissions for these contracts utilizing contract ID and exchange combination utilize the cached values to expedite order transmission speeds.

title: Introduction

The option chain for a given security can be returned using the function [EClient.reqContractDetails\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/request-contract-details). If an option contract is incompletely defined (for instance with the strike undefined) and used as an argument to [EClient.reqContractDetails\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/request-contract-details), a list of all matching option contracts will be returned.

One limitation of this technique is that the return of option chains will be throttled and take a longer time the more ambiguous the contract definition. The function [EClient.reqSecDefOptParams\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/option-chains/request-option-chains) was introduced that does not have the throttling limitation.

* It is not recommended to use [EClient.reqContractDetails\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/request-contract-details) to receive complete option chains on an underlying, e.g. all combinations of strikes/rights/expiries.
* For very large option chains returned from [EClient.reqContractDetails\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/request-contract-details), unchecking the setting in TWS Global Configuration at API -> Settings -> "Expose entire trading schedule to the API" will decrease the amount of data returned per option and help to return the contract list more quickly.

[EClient.reqSecDefOptParams\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/option-chains/request-option-chains) returns a list of expiries and a list of strike prices. In some cases, it is possible there are combinations of strike and expiry that would not give a valid option contract.

The function IBApi::EClient::reqMatchingSymbols is available to search for stock contracts. The input can be either the first few letters of the ticker symbol, or for longer strings, a character sequence matching a word in the security name. For instance to search for the stock symbol 'IBKR', the input 'I' or 'IB' can be used, as well as the word 'Interactive'. Up to 16 matching results are returned.

There must be an interval of at least 1 second between successive calls to reqMatchingSymbols

Matching stock contracts are returned to IBApi::EWrapper::symbolSamples with information about types of derivative contracts which exist (warrants, options, dutch warrants, futures).

title: Introduction
---
Forecast and Event Contracts enable investors to trade their opinion on specific yes-or-no questions on economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index and the Fed Funds Rate, climate indicators including temperatures and atmospheric CO2, key futures markets including  energy, metals, and equity indexes.



---
title: Introduction
---
Interactive Brokers models Event Contract instruments on options (for ForecastEx products) and futures options (for CME Group products).

Event Contracts can generally be thought of as options products in the TWS API, and their discovery workflow follows a familiar options-like sequence. This guide will make analogies to conventional index options for both ForecastEx and CME Group products.



---
title: ForecastEx Forecast Contracts
---
Forecast Contracts let you trade your view on the outcomes of various economic, government and environmental indicators, elections and tight races.

Each contract pays USD 1.00 at expiry if expiring in-the-money, and your max profit per contract is USD 1.00 minus the premium you paid to purchase the contract. Forecast Contracts are quoted in USD 0.01 increments.

ForecastEx Website: [https://forecastex.com/](https://forecastex.com/)



---
title: CME Event Contracts
---
CME event contracts let you trade your view on whether the price of key futures markets will move up or down by the end of each day's trading session.

Each contract pays USD 100.00 at expiry if expiring in-the-money, and your max profit per contract is USD 100.00 minus the premium you paid to purchase the contract (plus fees and commissions). CME event contracts are quoted in USD 1.00 increments.

ForecastEx Website: [https://www.cmegroup.com/activetrader/event-contracts.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/activetrader/event-contracts.html)



---
title: Introduction
---
IB's Event Contract instrument records use the following fields inherited from the options model:

* An **underlier**, which may or may not be artificial:
  + For **CME products**, a tradable Event Contract will have the relevant CME future as its underlier. Therefore, the security type of the CME contract will be a futures option, or "FOP".
  + For **ForecastEx products**, IB has generated an artificial underlying index which serves as a container for related Event Contracts in the same product class. These artificial indices do not have any associated reference values and are purely an artifact of the option instrument model used to represent these Event Contracts. However, these artificial underlying indices can be used to search for groups of related Event Contracts, just as with index options. Therefore, the security type of ForecastEx products are always options, or "OPT".
* An **Exchange** value will reflect the listing exchange of the given Event contract.
  + ForecastEx contracts will always use "FORECASTX" as the exchange value. Note the value does not include the final "E" in "ForecastEx".
  + A CME product may use "CBOT", "CME", "COMEX", or "NYMEX" depending on the contract's listing.
* A **Symbol** value which matches the symbol of the underlier, and which reflects the issuer's product code.
* A **Trading Class** which also reflects the issuer's product code for the instrument, and in the case of CME Group products, is used to differentiate Event Contracts from CME futures options.
  + Note that many CME Group Event Contracts, which resolve against CME Group futures, are assigned a Trading Class prefixed with "EC" and followed by the symbol of the relevant futures product, to avoid naming collisions with other derivatives (i.e., proper futures options listed on the same future).
* A **Put or Call (Right)** value, where Call = Yes and Put = No.
  + Note that ForecastEx instruments do not permit Sell orders. Instead, ForecastEx positions are flattened or reduced by buying the opposing contract. CME Group Event Contracts permit both buying and selling.
* An artificial **Contract Month** value, again used primarily for searching and filtering available instruments. Most Event Contract products do not follow monthly series as is common with index or equity options, so these Contract Month values are typically not a meaningful attribute of the instrument. Rather, they permit filtering of instruments by calendar month.
  + Requesting Contract Details for a given instrument will return a "realExpirationDate", which will correspond with the same values printed in the ForecastTrader page.
* A **Last Trade Date, Time, and Millisecond** values, which together indicate precisely when trading in an Event Contract will cease, just as with index options.
* A **Strike** value, which is the numerical value on which the event resolution hinges. Though numerical, this value need not represent a price.
* An **instrument description (or "local symbol")** in the form `"PRODUCT EXPIRATION STRIKE RIGHT"`, where:
  + `PRODUCT` is the issuer's product identifier
  + `EXPIRATION` is the date of the instrument's resolution in the form `MmmDD'YY`, e.g., "Sep26'24"
  + `STRIKE` is the numerical value that determines the contract's moneyness at expiration
  + `RIGHT` is a value YES or NO

title: ForecastEx Contract Example
---
Given the information above, we can establish a working example against the Global Carbon Dioxide Emissions contract on the [ForecastTrader Website](https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/eventtrader/#/markets).

Reviewing the page to the right, we can see all of the contract details necessary to get started.

1. Above the chart next to the contract name, we can see the Symbol, "GCE".
2. On the left side of the web page, we can find the contract's expiration date, June 30, 2026.
3. Equally important is the value on the right, "Market closes in 287 days."
4. The bolded excess on the top, 40,5000, indicates our strike price. This can be corroborated by the table on the left which acts like an Option Chain table users may be more familiar with.

While not explicitly stated in the web page, there are several details that may be inferred based on the information present:

1. All ForecastEx contracts use the "OPT" security type, as mentioned in the [Contract Definition & Discovery\](/tws-api/doc/event-trading/contract-definition-discovery/introduction) section above.
2. The ForecastEx exchange value is always listed as "FORECASTX".
3. All currently offered Event Contracts are hosted in the United States of America, and therefore will always use "USD" as their currency value.
4. "Yes" or "No" contracts are based on option rights, "Call" and "Put" respectively.

![Displays an example of a Forecast Contract being shown in the Forecast Trader.](/home/runner/work/API-documentation/API-documentation/fern/docs/assets/media/forecasttrader_gce.png)

In order to request our specific contract, we will need to focus on the "Market closes in 287 days" statement. This value indicates the last day the contract may be traded.

This document is written on the 19th of March, 2025. That is the 78th day of the calendar year.

Given the context that this is day 78, and the market will close in 287 days, the contract's last trade date would then be the 365th day of the year, or December 31st, 2025.

Given the TWS API date standards, this will be written as 20251231.

This information can now be distilled into a standard TWS API contract definition:

Symbol: "GCE"

SecType: "OPT"

Exchange: "FORECASTX"

Currency: "USD"

LastTradeDateOrContractMonth: "20251231"

---
title: Market Data
---
Requesting market data for event contracts will follow the same request structure as for any other security type.

Noted in our [Contract Definition & Discovery\](/tws-api/doc/event-trading/contract-definition-discovery/introduction) section, ForecastEx instruments do not support buying and selling. Therefore, "BID" and "ASK" values will not correlate to buy and sell values, but the "Highest Bid" and "Buy **Yes** Now at" prices for the Bid and Ask respectively.

Because "BID" and "ASK" do not correctly directly to Buying and Selling, historical "Trades" nor real-time "Last" prices will not be available.



---
title: Introduction
---
Order Submission for Event Contracts function the same as any other instrument offered at Interactive Brokers.

There are some unique order behaviors for both CME Group and ForecastEx contracts:

* Event Contracts only support Limit Orders* Event Contracts only support a Time in Force of Day, Good till Canceled, or Immediate-Or-Cancel.
  * Event Contracts do not support Cash Quantity in the TWS API. Orders must be submitted as whole-share values.
  * CME Group instruments can be bought and sold and function as normal futures options.
  * ForecastEx instruments cannot be sold, only bought. To exit or reduce a position, one must buy the opposing Event Contract, and IB will net the opposing positions together automatically.

**Event Contracts cannot be sold short.**



---
title: Order Example
---
Reviewing the same material as our [Contract Example\](/tws-api/doc/event-trading/contract-definition-discovery/forecast-ex-contract-example), we have all the tools needed to submit our order with some additional context available in the Order Ticket, featured on the right.

We are already aware that:

* ForecastEx contracts are always "BUY" orders.
* Event Contracts only support "LMT" as the Order Type.

This leaves us to decide the quantity, limit price, and time-in-force values.

We can set our limit price based on the values shown in the Order Ticket, or base the value on the Bid and Ask Price from our [Requested Market Data\](/tws-api/doc/event-trading/market-data).

![Displays an example of an order ticket being filled out for a Forecast Contract. ](/home/runner/work/API-documentation/API-documentation/fern/docs/assets/media/forecasttrader_gce_order_ticket-1-300x442.png)

title: Other Functionality
---
* Event Contracts fundamentally behave like Options or Futures Options. As a result, instrument rules, position information, and instrument-specific behavior will follow the same presentation in the Trader Workstation as those other instruments.
* Market Scanners are not currently available to research Event Contracts. Users will need to discover Event Contract symbols through [Interactive Brokers' ForecastTrader](https://forecasttrader.interactivebrokers.com/en/home.php).



---
title: Introduction
---
When a client application sends a message to TWS which requires a response which has an expected response (i.e. placing an order, requesting market data, subscribing to account updates, etc.), TWS will almost either always 1) respond with the relevant data or 2) send an error message to [EWrapper.error()\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/receiving-error-messages).

* **Exceptions when no response can occur**: Also, if a request is made prior to full establishment of connection (denoted by a returned 2104 or 2106 error code *"Data Server is Ok"*), there may not be a response from the request.

Error messages sent by the TWS are handled by the [EWrapper.error()\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/receiving-error-messages) method. The [EWrapper.error()\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/receiving-error-messages) event contains the originating request Id (or the orderId in case the error was raised when placing an order), a numeric error code and a brief description. It is important to keep in mind that this function is used for *true* error messages as well as notifications that do not mean anything is wrong.

**API Error Messages when TWS is not set to the English Language**

* Currently on the Windows platform, error messages are sent using Latin1 encoding. If TWS is launched in a non-Western language, it is recommended to enable the setting at Global Configuration -> API -> Settings to "Show API error messages in English".



---
title: Understanding Message Codes
---
The TWS uses the [EWrapper.error\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/receiving-error-messages) method not only to deliver errors but also warnings or informative messages. This is done mostly for simplicity's sake. Below is a table with all the messages which can be sent by the TWS/IB Gateway. All messages delivered by the TWS are usually accompanied by a brief but meaningful description pointing in the direction of the problem.

Remember that the TWS API simply connects to a running TWS/IB Gateway which most of times will be running on your local network if not in the same host as the client application. It is your responsibility to provide reliable connectivity between the TWS and your client application.



---
title: System Message Codes
---
The messages in the table below are not a consequence of any action performed by the client application. They are notifications about the connectivity status between the TWS and our servers. Your client application must pay special attention to them and handle the situation accordingly. You are very likely to lose connectivity to our servers at least once a day due to our daily server maintenance downtime as clearly detailed in our Current System Status page. Note that after the system reset, the TWS/IB Gateway will automatically reconnect to our servers and you can resume your operations normally.

**Note:**

1. During a reset period, there may be an interruption in the ability to log in or manage orders. Existing orders (native types) will operate normally although execution reports and simulated orders will be delayed until the reset is complete. It is not recommended to operate during the scheduled reset times.

| Code | TWS message | Additional notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1100 | Connectivity between IB and the TWS has been lost. | Your TWS/IB Gateway has been disconnected from IB servers. This can occur because of an internet connectivity issue, a nightly reset of the IB servers, or a competing session. |

The content below references some of the most common errors received by clients at Interactive Brokers, and offers direct resolutions for the matters in most instances. If further information is required, please feel to contact [Customer Service](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/support/customer-service.php?p=contact) for additional insight.

title: Market data farm connection is OK
---
Error code 2104, 2106, and 2158 all generally state that farm connection is OK. What this means is that the API has successfully connected to Trader Workstation or the IB Gateway, and that connection is able to reach Interactive Brokers servers. There is no issue with the connection, and it is a sign you connected successfully.

While using IB Gateway, users may encounter the error, "A historical data farm connection has become inactive but should be available upon demand." This means that while no historical data requests are being sent, the connection is halted. Once a historical data request is sent over the API connection, the market data farm will reconnect and supply market data.



---
title: >-
  Requested market data requires additional subscription for API. See link in
  'Market Data Connections' dialog for more details.Delayed market data is
  available.
---
Error 10089 notes that clients are requesting market data when they do not maintain a valid market data subscription. To resolve this issue, users must add a market data subscription to the specific user they are requesting market data with. Alternatively, users must [request delayed market data\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-delayed/introduction) prior to requesting market data.

Market data availability is different in [TWS versus the API]. As a result, market data you can receive in Trader Workstation may not be available in the API.

Interactive Brokers lists many of our most popular market data subscriptions [here].

| 1 | Groups | offer traders a way to create a group of accounts and apply a single allocation method to all accounts in the group. |
| 2 | Account Aliases | let you easily identify the accounts by meaningful names rather than account numbers. |

**Note:**

In order to confirm that your FA changes were saved, you may wait for the [EWrapper.replaceFAEnd](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/receiving-fa-groups-and-profiles) callback, which provides the corresponding reqId. In addition, after saving changes, it is advised to verify the new FA setup via [EClient.requestFA](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/request-fa-groups-and-profiles). If it is called before changes are fully saved, you may receive an error, such as error 10230. See Message Codes.

[EClient.replaceFA\](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/replace-fa-allocations) only accepts faDataType 1 now. Otherwise, it may trigger [error 585\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/error-codes).

#### EWrapper.replaceFAEnd (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**text:** String. the message text.

)

Marks the ending of the replaceFA reception.

title: Allocation Methods and Groups
---
A number of methods for account allocations are available with Financial Advisor and IBroker account structures to specify how trades should be distributed across multiple accounts.

Allocation Groups can be created or modified in the Trader Workstation directly as described in [TWS: Allocations and Transfers](https://www.ibkrguides.com/tws/usersguidebook/financialadvisors/create%20an%20account%20group%20for%20share%20allocation.htm).

Alternatively, allocation groups can be created or modified through the [EClient.replaceFA()](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/replace-fa-allocations) method in the API.

Interactive Brokers supports two forms of allocation methods. Allocation methods that have calculations completed by Interactive Brokers, and a set of allocation methods calculated by the user and then specified.

#### IB-computed allocation methods

* [Available Equity](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/allocation-method-xml-format/available-equity)
* [Equal Quantity](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/allocation-method-xml-format/equal-quantity)
* [Net Liquidation Value](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/allocation-method-xml-format/net-liquidation-value)

#### User-specified allocation methods

###### Formerly known as Allocation Profiles

* [Cash Quantity](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/allocation-method-xml-format/monetary-amount)
* [Percentages](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/allocation-method-xml-format/percentages)
* [Ratios](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/allocation-method-xml-format/ratios)
* [Shares](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/allocation-method-xml-format/contracts-or-shares)



---
title: Introduction
---
Allocation methods for financial advisor's allocation groups are created using an XML format. The content below signifies the supported allocation groups and how to format them in their respective XML.



---
title: Available Equity
---
Requires you to specify an order size. This method distributes shares based on the amount of available equity in each account. The system calculates ratios based on the Available Equity in each account and allocates shares based on these ratios.

**Example:** You transmit an order for 700 shares of stock XYZ. The account group includes three accounts, A, B and C with available equity in the amounts of $25,000, $50,000 and $100,000 respectively. The system calculates a ratio of 1:2:4 and allocates 100 shares to Client A, 200 shares to Client B, and 400 shares to Client C.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ListOfGroups>
  <Group>
    <name>MyTestProfile2</name>
    <defaultMethod>AvailableEquity</defaultMethod>
    <ListOfAccts varName="list">
      <Account>
        <acct>DU6202167</acct>
      </Account>
      <Account>
        <acct>DU6202168</acct>
      </Account>
    </ListOfAccts>
  </Group>
</ListOfGroups>
```



---
title: Contracts Or Shares
---
This method allocates the absolute number of shares you enter to each account listed. If you use this method, the order size is calculated by adding together the number of shares allocated to each account in the profile.

**Example:**

Assume an order for 300 shares of stock ABC is transmitted.

In the example code shown in the right side, you can see that:

1. Account A is set to receive 100.0 shares while Account B is set to receive 200.0 shares. Account A should receive 100 shares and Account B should receive 200 shares.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ListOfGroups>
  <Group>
  <name>MyTestProfile2</name>
  <defaultMethod>ContractsOrShares</defaultMethod>
  
  <ListOfAccts varName="list">
  <Account>
    <acct>DU6202167</acct>
    <amount>100.0</amount>
  </Account>
  <Account>
    <acct>DU6202168</acct>
    <amount>200.0</amount>
  </Account>
  </ListOfAccts>
  </Group>
</ListOfGroups>
```



---
title: Equal Quantity
---
Requires you to specify an order size. This method distributes shares equally between all accounts in the group.

**Example:** You transmit an order for 400 shares of stock ABC. If your Account Group includes four accounts, each account receives 100 shares. If your Account Group includes six accounts, each account receives 66 shares, and then 1 share is allocated to each account until all are distributed.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ListOfGroups>
  <Group>
    <name>MyTestProfile2</name>
    <defaultMethod>Equal</defaultMethod>
    <ListOfAccts varName="list">
      <Account>
        <acct>DU6202167</acct>
      </Account>
      <Account>
        <acct>DU6202168</acct>
      </Account>
    </ListOfAccts>
  </Group>
</ListOfGroups>
```



---
title: MonetaryAmount
---
The Monetary Amount method calculates the number of units to be allocated based on the monetary value assigned to each account.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ListOfGroups>
  <Group>
  <name>MyTestProfile2</name>
  <defaultMethod>MonetaryAmount</defaultMethod>
  
  <ListOfAccts varName="list">
  <Account>
    <acct>DU6202167</acct>
    <amount>1000.0</amount>
  </Account>
  <Account>
    <acct>DU6202168</acct>
    <amount>2000.0</amount>
  </Account>
  </ListOfAccts>
  </Group>
</ListOfGroups>
```



---
title: Net Liquidation Value
---
Requires you to specify an order size. This method distributes shares based on the net liquidation value of each account. The system calculates ratios based on the Net Liquidation value in each account and allocates shares based on these ratios.

**Example:** You transmit an order for 700 shares of stock XYZ. The account group includes three accounts, A, B and C with Net Liquidation values of $25,000, $50,000 and $100,000 respectively. The system calculates a ratio of 1:2:4 and allocates 100 shares to Client A, 200 shares to Client B, and 400 shares to Client C.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ListOfGroups>
  <Group>
    <name>MyTestProfile2</name>
    <defaultMethod>NetLiq</defaultMethod>
    <ListOfAccts varName="list">
      <Account>
        <acct>DU6202167</acct>
      </Account>
      <Account>
        <acct>DU6202168</acct>
      </Account>
    </ListOfAccts>
  </Group>
</ListOfGroups>
```



---
title: Percentages
---
This method will split the total number of shares in the order between listed accounts based on the percentages you indicate.

**Example:**

Assume an order for 300 shares of stock ABC is transmitted.

In the example code shown in the right side, you can see that:

1. Account A is set to have 60.0 percentage while Account B is set to have 40.0 percentage. Account A should receive 180 shares and Account B should receive 120 shares.

While making modifications to allocations for profiles, the method uses an enumerated value. The number shown below demonstrates precisely what profile corresponds to which value.

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **BUY ORDER** | *Positive Percent* | *Negative Percent* |
| Long Position | Increases position | No effect |
| Short Position | No effect | Decreases position |

|  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SELL ORDER** | *Positive Percent* | *Negative Percent* |
| Long Position | No effect | Decreases position |
| Short Position | Increases position | No effect |

**Note:**  
Do not specify an order size. Since the quantity is calculated by the system, the order size is displayed in the Quantity field after the order is acknowledged. This method increases or decreases an already existing position. Positive percents will increase a position, negative percents will decrease a position. For exmaple, to fully close out a position, you just need to specify percentage to be -100.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ListOfGroups>
  <Group>
  <name>MyTestProfile2</name>
  <defaultMethod>Percent</defaultMethod>
  <ListOfAccts varName="list">
  <Account>
    <acct>DU6202167</acct>
    <amount>60.0</amount>
  </Account>
  <Account>
    <acct>DU6202168</acct>
    <amount>40.0</amount>
  </Account>
  </ListOfAccts>
  </Group>
</ListOfGroups>
```



---
title: Ratios
---
This method calculates the allocation of shares based on the ratios you enter.

**Example:**

Assume an order for 300 shares of stock ABC is transmitted.

In the example code shown in the right side, you can see that:

1. A ratio of 1.0 and 2.0 is set to Account A and Account B. Account A should receive 100 shares and Account B should receive 200 shares.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<ListOfGroups>
  <Group>
  <name>MyTestProfile2</name>
  <defaultMethod>Ratio</defaultMethod>
  
  <ListOfAccts varName="list">
  <Account>
    <acct>DU6202167</acct>
    <amount>1.0</amount>
  </Account>
  <Account>
    <acct>DU6202168</acct>
    <amount>2.0</amount>
  </Account>
  </ListOfAccts>
  </Group>
</ListOfGroups>
```



---
title: Model Portfolios and the API
---
Advisors can use Model Portfolios to easily invest some or all of a client's assets into one or multiple custom-created portfolios, rather than tediously managing individual investments in single instruments.

[More about Model Portfolios](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=20917)

The TWS API can access model portfolios in accounts where this functionality is available and a specific model has previously been setup in TWS. API functionality allows the client application to request model position update subscriptions, request model account update subscriptions, or place orders to a specific model.

Model Portfolio functionality **not** available in the TWS API:

* Portfolio Model Creation
* Portfolio Model Rebalancing
* Portfolio Model Position or Cash Transfer

To request position updates from a specific model, the function [IBApi::EClient::reqPositionsMulti\](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/positions-by-model/request-positions-by-model) "Requests position subscription for account and/or model Initially all positions are returned...") can be used: [Position Update Subscription by Model\](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/positions-by-model/receive-positions-by-model)

To request model account updates, there is the function [IBApi::EClient::reqAccountUpdatesMulti\](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-update-by-model/requesting-account-update-by-model "Requests account updates for account and/or model. "), see: [Account Value Update Subscriptions by Model\](/tws-api/doc/account-portfolio-data/account-update-by-model/receiving-account-updates-by-model)

To place an order to a model, the IBApi.Order.ModelCode field must be set accordingly, for example:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python" language="python">
    ```python
    modelOrder = Order()
    modelOrder.account = "DF12345"
    modelOrder.modelCode = "Technology" # model for tech stocks first created in TWS
    self.placeOrder(self.nextOrderId(), contract, modelOrder)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Java" language="java">
    ```java
    Order modelOrder = Order();
    modelOrder.account("DF12345");  // master FA account number
    modelOrder.modelCode("Technology"); // model for tech stocks first created in TWS
    client.placeOrder(nextOrderId++, contract, modelOrder);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="C++" language="cpp">
    ```cpp
    Order modelOrder = Order();
    modelOrder.account = "DF12345";
    modelOrder.modelCode = "Technology";
    m_pClient->placeOrder(m_orderId++, contract, modelOrder);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="C#" language="csharp">
    ```csharp
    Order modelOrder = Order();
    modelOrder.Account = "DF12345";  // master FA account number
    modelOrder.ModelCode = "Technology"; // model for tech stocks first created in TWS
    client.placeOrder(nextOrderId++, contract, modelOrder);
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="VB.NET" language="vbnet">
    ```vbnet
    Dim modelOrder As Order = Order()
    modelOrder.Account = "DF12345" 'master FA account number
    modelOrder.ModelCode = "Technology" 'model for tech stocks first created in TWS
    client.placeOrder(increment(nextOrderId), contract, modelOrder)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



---
title: Unification of Groups and Profiles
---
With TWS/IBGW build 983+, the API settings will have a new flag/checkbox, **"Use Account Groups with Allocation Methods"** (enabled by default for new users). If not enabled, groups and profiles would behave the same as before. If it is checked, group and profile functionality will be merged.

With TWS/IBGW Build 10.20+, this setting is now enabled by default, and moving forward into new versions, the two systems can be deemed as interchangeable for modifying allocation groups, placing orders, requesting account or portfolio summaries, or requesting multiple positions.



---
title: Order Placement
---
For advisors to place orders to their [allocation groups\](/tws-api/doc/financial-advisors/replace-fa-allocations) users would simply declare their allocation group name in the order object. This would be done with the Order's faGroup field. The example to the right references a standard market order placed to our allocation group, MyTestProfile.

title: Introduction
---
Delayed market data can **only** be used with [EClient.reqMktData\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data) and  [EClient.reqHistoricalData\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-bars/requesting-historical-bars). This does not function for tick data.

The API can request Live, Frozen, Delayed and Delayed Frozen market data from Trader Workstation by switching market data type via the [EClient.reqMarketDataType](#request-md-type) before making a market data request. A successful switch to a different (non-live) market data type for a particular market data request will be indicated by a callback to [EWrapper.marketDataType](#receive-md-type "Returns the market data type (real-time, frozen, delayed, delayed-frozen) of ticker sent by EClientSo...") with the ticker ID of the market data request which is returning a different type of data.

* A [EClient.reqMarketDataType](#request-md-type) callback of **1** will occur automatically after invoking reqMktData if the user has live data permissions for the instrument.

| Market Data Type | ID | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live | 1 | Live market data is streaming data relayed back in real time. Market data subscriptions are required to receive live market data. |
| Frozen | 2 | Frozen market data is the last data recorded at market close. In TWS, Frozen data is displayed in gray numbers. When you set the market data type to Frozen, you are asking TWS to send the last available quote when there is not one currently available. For instance, if a market is currently closed and real time data is requested, -1 values will commonly be returned for the bid and ask prices to indicate there is no current bid/ask data available. TWS will often show a 'frozen' bid/ask which represents the last value recorded by the system. To receive the last know bid/ask price before the market close, switch to market data type 2 from the API before requesting market data. API frozen data requires TWS/IBG v.962 or higher and the same market data subscriptions necessary for real time streaming data. |
| Delayed | 3 | Free, delayed data is 15 – 20 minutes delayed. In TWS, delayed data is displayed in brown background. When you set market data type to delayed, you are telling TWS to automatically switch to delayed market data if the user does not have the necessary real time data subscription. If live data is available a request for delayed data would be ignored by TWS. Delayed market data is returned with delayed [Tick Types](#available-tick-types) (Tick ID 66~76). |
| Delayed Frozen | 4 | Requests delayed "frozen" data for a user without market data subscriptions. |



---
title: Market Data Type Behavior
---
1) If user sends reqMarketDataType(1) – TWS will start sending only regular (1) market data.

2) If user sends reqMarketDataType(2) – frozen, TWS will start sending regular (1) as default and frozen (2) market data. TWS sends marketDataType callback (1 or 2) indicating what market data will be sent after this callback. It can be regular or frozen.

3) If user sends reqMarketDataType(3) – delayed, TWS will start sending regular (1) as default and delayed (3) market data.

4) If user sends reqMarketDataType(4) – delayed-frozen, TWS will start sending regular (1) as default, delayed (3) and delayed-frozen (4) market data.

Interactive Brokers data will always try to provide the most up to date market data possible, but will permit additional delayed or frozen data if available upon request.

title: Introduction
---
Historical Market data is available for Interactive Brokers market data subscribers in a range of methods and structures. This includes requests for historical bars, identical to the Trader Workstation, historical Time & Sales, as well as Histogram data.



---
title: Introduction
---
Historical market data has it's own set of market data limitations unique to other requests such as real time market data. This section will cover all limitations that effect historical market data in the Trader Workstation API.



---
title: Historical Data Filtering
---
Historical data at IB is filtered for trade types which occur away from the NBBO such as combo legs, block trades, and derivative trades. For that reason the daily volume from the (unfiltered) real time data functionality will generally be larger than the (filtered) historical volume reported by historical data functionality. Also, differences are expected in other fields such as the VWAP between the real time and historical data feeds.

As historical data at IB gets adjusted, compressed and filtered by default, there may be historical data differences if you request historical data at different time points.

See our FAQ for more insight, [here](/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/102546341).



---
title: Historical Volume Scaling
---
Volume data returned for historical bars can be modified to return in shares or lots.

1. Open the Global Configuration window
2. Navigate to "API" and then "Settings" on the left pane
3. Scroll down to the "Send market data in lots for US Stocks for dual-mode API clients"

If the setting is checked, historical volume data will return as a [Round Lot](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roundlot.asp).

If the setting is unchecked, historical volume data will return in Shares.

title: Pacing Violations for Small Bars (30 secs or less)
---
Although Interactive Brokers offers our clients high quality market data, IB is not a specialised market data provider and as such it is forced to put in place restrictions to limit traffic which is not directly associated to trading. A Pacing Violation occurs whenever one or more of the following restrictions is not observed:

Important: these limitations apply to all our clients and it is not possible to overcome them. If your trading strategy's market data requirements are not met by our market data services please consider contacting a specialized provider.

* Making identical historical data requests within 15 seconds.
* Making six or more historical data requests for the same Contract, Exchange and Tick Type within two seconds.
* Making more than 60 requests within any ten minute period.
* Note that when BID\_ASK historical data is requested, each request is counted twice. In a nutshell, the information above can simply be put as "do not request too much data too quick".



---
title: Unavailable Historical Data
---
The other historical data limitations listed are general limitations for all trading platforms:

* Bars whose size is 30 seconds or less older than six months
* Expired futures data older than two years counting from the future's expiration date.
* Expired options, FOPs, warrants and structured products.
* End of Day (EOD) data for options, FOPs, warrants and structured products.
* Data for expired future spreads
* Data for securities which are no longer trading.
* Native historical data for combos. Historical data is not stored in the IB database separately for combos.; combo historical data in TWS or the API is the sum of data from the legs.
* Historical data for securities which move to a new exchange will often not be available prior to the time of the move. For example, SOXX stock moved to NASDAQ exchange on 15 Oct 2010, so no SOXX data before 15 Oct 2010 can be retrieved despite SOXX was listed in 2001. This limitation also applied to contract which specifies `SMART` as the exchange.
* Studies and indicators such as Weighted Moving Averages or Bollinger Bands are not available from the API.
* Time & Sales data beyond 3 years.



---
title: Introduction
---
For many functions, such as EClient.reqHistoricalData, you will need to request market data for a contract. Given that you may not know how long a symbol has been available, you can use EClient.reqHeadTimestamp to find the first available point of data for a given whatToShow value.

ReqHeadTimeStamp counts as an ongoing historical data request, similar to using EClient.reqHistoricalData's keepUpToDate=True flag. As a result, users should always:

* Cancel timestamp requests using [EClient.cancelHeadTimeStamp\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/finding-the-earliest-available-data-point/cancelling-timestamp-requests).
* All EClient.reqHeadTimestamp requests follow the [30 second bar limitations\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-data-limitations/introduction), regardless of which bar size value has been requested.

---
title: Duration
---
The Interactive Brokers Historical Market Data maintains a duration parameter which specifies the overall length of time that data can be collected. The duration specified will derive the bars of data that can then be collected.

#### Valid Duration String Units:

| Unit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| S | Seconds |
| D | Day |
| W | Week |
| M | Month |
| Y | Year |



---
title: Historical Bar Sizes
---
Bar sizes dictate the data returned by historical bar requests. The bar size will dictate the scale over which the OHLC/V is returned to the API.

#### Valid Bar Sizes:

| Bar Unit | Bar Sizes |
| --- | --- |
| secs | 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 |
| mins | 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 |
| hours | 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 |
| day | 1 |
| weeks | 1 |
| months | 1 |



---
title: Step Sizes
---
The functionality of market data requests are predicated on preset step sizes. As such, not all bar sizes will work with all duration values. The table listed here will discuss the smallest to largest bar size value for each duration string.

| Duration Unit | Bar units allowed | Bar size Interval (Min/Max) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S | secs | mins | 1 secs -> 1mins |
| D | secs | mins | hrs | 5 secs -> 1 hours |
| W | sec | mins | hrs | 10 secs -> 4 hrs |
| M | sec | mins | hrs | 30 secs -> 8 hrs |
| Y | mins | hrs   | d | 1 mins-> 1 day |



---
title: Max Duration Per Bar Size
---
The table below displays the maximum duration values allowed for a given bar.

As an example, the maximum duration for Seconds values supported for 5 seconds bars are 86400 S. This means that if I want to retrieve more than 1 day's worth of 5 second bars, I will then need to request data in increments of D (days).

| Bar Size | Max Second Duration | Max Day Duration | Max Week Duration | Max Month Duration | Max Year Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 secs | 2000 S | \{Not Supported\} | \{Not Supported\} | \{Not Supported\} | \{Not Supported\} |
| 5 secs | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 10 secs | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 15 secs | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 30 secs | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 1 min | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 2 mins | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 3 mins | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 5 mins | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 10 mins | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 15 mins | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 20 mins | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 30 mins | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 1 hour | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 2 hours | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 3 hours | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 4 hours | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 8 hours | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 1 day | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 1M | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |
| 1W | 86400 S | 365 D | 52 W | 12 M | 68 Y |



---
title: Format Date Received
---
Interactive Brokers will return historical market data based on the format set from the request. The formatDate parameter can be provided an integer value to indicate how data should be returned.

**Note:** Day bars will only return dates in the yyyyMMdd format. Time data is not available.

| Value | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | String Time Zone Date | "20231019 16:11:48 America/New\_York" |
| 2 | Epoch Date | 1697746308 |
| 3 | Day & Time Date | "1019 16:11:48 America/New\_York" |



---
title: Keep Up To Date
---
When using keepUpToDate=True for historical data requests, you will see several bars returned with the same timestamp. This is because data is updated approximately every 4-6 seconds. These updates compound until the end of the specified bar size.

In our example to the below, 15 second bars are requested, and we can see the 30 second bar built out incrementally until 20231204 13:30:30 is completed. At which point, we move on to the 45th second bars. This same logic extends into minute, hourly, or daily bars.

keepUpToDate is only available for whatToShow: Trades, Midpoint, Bid, Ask

title: Introduction

The highest granularity of historical data from IB's database can be retrieved using the API function [EClient.reqHistoricalTicks\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-time-sales/requesting-time-and-sales-data) for historical time and sales values. Historical Time & Sales will return the same data as what is available in Trader Workstation under the Time and Sales window. This is a series of ticks indicating each trade based on the requested values.

* Historical Tick-By-Tick data is not available for combos.
* Historical tick data is only available for the last 3 years.
* Data will not be returned from multiple trading sessions in a single request; Multiple requests must be used.
* To complete a full second, more ticks may be returned than requested.
* Time & Sales data requires a Level 1, Top Of Book market data subscription. This would be the same subscription as [EClient.reqMktData()\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data) or [EClient.reqHistoricalData()\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-bars/requesting-historical-bars).



---
title: Requesting Time and Sales data
---
#### EClient.reqHistoricalTicks (

**requestId:** *int*, id of the request

**contract:** *Contract*, Contract object that is subject of query.

**startDateTime:** *String*, i.e. "20170701 12:01:00". Uses TWS timezone specified at login.

**endDateTime:** *String*, i.e. "20170701 13:01:00". In TWS timezone. Exactly one of startDateTime or endDateTime must be defined.

**numberOfTicks:** *int*, Number of distinct data points. Max is 1000 per request.

**whatToShow:** *String*, (Bid\_Ask, Midpoint, or Trades) Type of data requested.

**useRth:** *bool*, Data from regular trading hours (1), or all available hours (0).

**ignoreSize:** *bool*, Omit updates that reflect only changes in size, and not price. Applicable to Bid\_Ask data requests.  
**Note:** Options and Future Options will only display a value of 1, unless to indicate a removed bid/ask, which will instead return a price and size value of 0.

**miscOptions:** *list,* Should be defined as *null*; reserved for internal use.  
)

Requests historical Time & Sales data for an instrument.

The tick attribute pastLimit is also returned with streaming Tick-By-Tick responses. Check Halted and Unhalted ticks section.

* If tick has zero price, zero size and pastLimit flag is set – this is "Halted" tick.
* If tick has zero price, zero size and followed immediately after "Halted" tick – this is "Unhalted" tick.

title: Introduction
---
When creating dates in the TWS API, Interactive Brokers typically supports three methods:

1. [Operator Time Zone\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-date-formatting/operator-time-zone)
2. [Exchange Time Zone\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-date-formatting/exchange-time-zone)
3. [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-date-formatting/coordinated-universal-time-utc)



---
title: Operator Time Zone
---
Operator Time Zone is the local time set by the user in Trader Workstation. The Operator Time Zone typically maintains a unique formatting structure separate from Exchange Time Zones; however, they can match.

A user can confirm their Operator Time Zone by launching Trader Workstation then, before logging in, click "More Options >".

![More Options button on the TWS login window. ](file:docs/assets/media/twsLogin-700x407.png)

Users can then confirm their active Operator Time Zone by referencing the "Time Zone" field.

For US residents, this will typically appear as "America/New\_York", "America/Chicago", or "America/Los\_Angeles". It is essential to note the Time Zone value, as this will be the value supplied when making requests with the Operator Time Zone.

![More Options settings on the TWS login window.](file:docs/assets/media/twsMoreOptions-1-700x406.png)

After logging in to Trader Workstation or IB Gateway, you would be able to submit time stamps in the format of "YYYYMMDD HH:mm:ss Operator/Time\_Zone".

Given our prior example, a historical data endDateTime value would appear as"20250101 23:59:59 America/Chicago". This would mean the latest value I want is just before midnight in Chicago on January 1st, 2025. Even if I am trading contracts in New York or overseas, all historical data requests would be relative to my own time zone.



---
title: Exchange Time Zone
---
The exchange Time Zone is the value the exchange itself uses to calculate time. This value is typically unique to the Operator Time Zone, but these values can overlap.

As an example, the New York Stock Exchange operates on "US/Eastern". However, the CME operates on "US/Central". This values can be programmatically requested using the EClient.reqContractDetails method, and then received from EWrapper.contractDetails in contractDetails.Time ZoneId.

Note that this will be interpreted differently from "America/Chicago".

![Time Zone response from a reqContractDetails request.](file:docs/assets/media/exchangeTimeZone.png)



---
title: Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
---
UTC is a time standard centered around Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). UTC historical data can be formatted as "YYYYMMDD-hh:mm:ss". Please keep in mind this is based on UTC+0, and as a reference, US/Eastern time is approximately UTC-4 or UTC-5 depending on U.S. Daylight savings.

Please note GMT is unaffected by Daylight savings, and so 09:00:00 will be the same time of day year round regardless of the exchange's or your local daylight savings observation.



---
title: Modifying Returned Date
---
You may also log in to the Trader Workstation and modify this in the Global Configuration under API and then Settings. Here, you will find a modifiable setting labeled "Send instrument-specific attributes for dual-mode API client in" Here you can select one of the following:

* operator timezone: refers to the local timezone you have set in the Trader Workstation or IB Gateway
* instrument timezone: refers to the timezone of the requested exchange. If "SMART" is used, this will use the instrument's primary exchange.
* UTC format: refers to a standardized return using UTC as the timezone. This will be returned in the format YYYYMMDD-hh:mm:ss

![](file:docs/assets/media/Hist_Return_Setting-700x448.png)



---
title: Live Data Limitations
---
For all data, besides [Delayed Watchlist Data\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-delayed/introduction), a paid data subscription is required to receive market data through the API. See the [Market Data Subscriptions] page for more information.

* Live market data and historical bars are currently not available from the API for the exchange **OSE**. Only 15 minute delayed streaming data will be available for this exchange.
* Some [Available Tick Types\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/available-tick-types/introduction) may not be provided due to the contract details, the time that you run the code…… ,etc. To verify whether the specific Available Tick Type is provided, it is suggested to manually check the data in TWS.
* Different [Available Tick Types\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/available-tick-types/introduction) have different updating frequency.

The bid, ask, and last size quotes are displayed in shares instead of lots.

API users have the option to configure the TWS API to work in compatibility mode for older programs, but we recommend migrating to "quotes in shares" at your earliest convenience.

To display quotes as lots, from the Global Configuration > API > Settings page, check "Bypass US Stocks market data in shares warning for API orders."

![Highlights the "Bypass US Stocks market data in shares warning for API Orders" under API Precautions.](/home/runner/work/API-documentation/API-documentation/fern/docs/assets/media/bypass_usstk_api_shares-700x398.png)

title: Introduction

Real time and historical data functionality is combined through the EClient.reqRealTimeBars request. reqRealTimeBars will create an active subscription that will return a single bar in real time every five seconds that has the OHLC values over that period. reqRealTimeBars can only be used with a bar size of 5 seconds.

**Important:** real time bars subscriptions combine the limitations of both, top and historical market data. Make sure you observe Market Data Lines and [Pacing Violations for Small Bars (30 secs or less)\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-data-limitations/introduction). For example, no more than 60 **\*new\*** requests for real time bars can be made in 10 minutes, and the total number of active active subscriptions of all types cannot exceed the maximum allowed market data lines for the user.

title: Introduction
---
A single data request from the API can receive aggregate quotes from multiple exchanges. The tick types 'bidExch' (tick type 32), 'askExch' (tick type 33), 'lastExch' (tick type 84) are used to identify the source of a quote. To preserve bandwidth, the data returned to these tick types consists of a sequence of capital letters rather than a long list of exchange names for every returned exchange name field. To find the full exchange name corresponding to a single letter code returned in tick types 32, 33, or 84, and API function IBApi::[EClient::reqSmartComponents](#exchange-component-mapping) is available. Note: This function can only be used when the exchange is open.

Different IB contracts have a different exchange map containing the set of exchanges on which they trade. Each exchange map has a different code, such as "a6" or "a9". This exchange mapping code is returned to [EWrapper.tickReqParams](#exchange-component-mapping) immediately after a market data request is made by a user with market data subscriptions. To find a particular map of single letter codes to full exchange names, the function reqSmartComponents is invoked with the exchange mapping code returned to tickReqParams.

For instance, a market data request for the IBKR US contract may return the exchange mapping identifier "a6" to [EWrapper.tickReqParams](#exchange-component-mapping) . Invoking the function [EClient.reqSmartComponents](#exchange-component-mapping) with the symbol "a9" will reveal the list of exchanges offering market data for the IBKR US contract, and their single letter codes. The code for "ARCA" may be "P". In that case if "P" is returned to the exchange tick types, that would indicate the quote was provided by ARCA.

title: Introduction

Market depth data, also known as level II, represents an instrument's order book. Via the TWS API it is possible to obtain this information with the [EClient.reqMarketDepth\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/market-depth-l-2/introduction) function.

Unlike [Top Market Data (Level I)\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data), market depth data is sent without sampling or filtering, however we cannot guarantee that every price quoted for a particular security will be displayed. In particular, odd lot orders are not included.

It is possible to Smart-route a [EClient.reqMarketDepth\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/market-depth-l-2/introduction) request to receive aggregated data from all available exchanges.

An integral part of processing the incoming data is monitoring [EWrapper.error\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/receiving-error-messages) for message 317 "Market depth data has been RESET. Please empty deep book contents before applying any new entries." and handling it appropriately, otherwise the update process would be corrupted.

title: Request Market Depth
---
**Important:** Please note that the languages use different method names for requesting market depth.

The C# and Visual Basic APIs use **reqMarketDepth()**.

The Python, Java, and C++ APIs use **reqMktDepth()**.

#### EClient.reqMarketDepth (

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**contract:** Contract. The Contract for which the depth is being requested.

**numRows:** int. The number of rows on each side of the order book.

**isSmartDepth:** bool. Flag indicates that this is a Smart-routed market depth request. Supplying true will return data identical to the [TWS Book Trader](https://www.ibkrguides.com/traderworkstation/booktrader.htm) while False returns direct routed data similar to the [TWS Market Depth tool](https://www.ibkrguides.com/traderworkstation/level-ii-market-depth.htm).

**mktDepthOptions:** List. Internal use only. Leave an empty array or None type.  
)

Requests the contract's market depth (order book).

Most indicators made available within the Trader Workstation are unavailable in the API. For more information on data not being available in via API, see [here].

Some indicators are an exception to this rule. such as:

* NYSE Advance-Decline
* NYSE Volume
* NYSE TICK Index
* NYSE Trading (TRIN or Arms) Index



---
title: NYSE Advance-Decline
---
The Advanced-Decline index must be requested with [EClient.reqMktData()\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data) where:

* Advancing values correlate to the "BID" and "BID\_SIZE".
* Declining values correlate to the "ASK" and "ASK\_SIZE".

```
Symbol = "AD-NYSE"
SecType = "IND"
Exchange = "NYSE"

---
title: NYSE Volume Index
---
The Volume index must be requested with [EClient.reqMktData()\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data) where:

* Bid Price correlates to "UP Volume"
* Ask Price correlates to "Down Volume"
* Bid Size correlates to "Unchanged Volume"
* Ask Size will always return as 1.

```
Symbol = "VOL-NYSE"
SecType = "IND"
Exchange = "NYSE"
Currency = "USD"
```



---
title: NYSE Trading Index (TRIN)
---
The Trade index must be requested with [EClient.reqMktData()\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data) where:

* Last Price correlates to calculation of (Advancing Issues / Declining Issues) / (Advancing Volume / Declining Volume)
* Close price correlates to the final calculation of the value from the previous day.
* Bid, Ask, and all Size data that returns will come as -1 or 0. These values are passed automatically and are non-representative.

title: NYSE TICK Index
---
The TICK index must be requested with [EClient.reqMktData()\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data) where:

* Last Price correlates to the calculation of rising stocks minus declining stocks.
* Bid, Ask, Close, and all Size data that returns will come as -1 or 0. These values are passed automatically and are non-representative.

---
title: Introduction
---
The option greek values- delta, gamma, theta, vega- are returned by default following a reqMktData() request for the option. See Available Tick Types

Tick types "Bid Option Computation" (#10), "Ask Option Computation" (#11), "Last Option Computation" (#12), and "Model Option Computation" (#13) return all Greeks (delta, gamma, vega, theta), the underlying price and the stock and option reference price when requested.

MODEL\_OPTION\_COMPUTATION also returns model implied volatility.

Note that to receive live greek values it is necessary to have market data subscriptions for both the option and the underlying contract.

The implied volatility for an option given its price and the price of the underlying can be calculated with the function EClient.calculateImpliedVolatility.

Alternatively, given the price of the underlying and an implied volatility it is possible to calculate the option price using the function EClient.calculateOptionPrice.

After the request, the option specific information will be delivered via the EWrapper.tickOptionComputation method.

title: Request Options Greeks
---
#### EClient.reqMktData (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier for tracking data.

**contract:** Contract. Contract object used for specifying an instrument.

**regulatorySnapshot:** bool. Set to True for a paid, regulatory snapshot or False for live data.

**mktDataOptions:** List\<TagValue>. Internal use only.  
)

Greeks are requested automatically when pulling market data for an Options contract.  
Users that do not have a valid [Market Data Subscription] for the underlying contract will receive an error that Market Data Is Not Subscribed. This error can be ignored if Greeks are not wanted.

title: Introduction
---
Streaming market data values corresponding to data shown in TWS watchlists is available via the EClient.reqMktData. This data is not tick-by-tick but consists of aggregate snapshots taken several times per second. A set of 'default' tick types are returned by default from a call to EClient.reqMktData, and additional tick types are available by specifying the corresponding generic tick type in the market data request. Including the generic tick types many, but not all, types of data are available that can be displayed in TWS watchlists by adding additional columns.



---
title: Request Watchlist Data
---
#### EClient.reqMktData (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier for tracking data.

**contract:** Contract. Contract object used for specifying an instrument.

**[genericTickList](#generic-tick-types):** String. Comma separated ids of the available generic ticks.

[**snapshot:**](#streaming-data-snapshot) bool. Used to retrieve a single snapshot of data for those with an existing market data subscirption.

[**regulatorySnapshot:**](#regulatory-snapshot) bool. Used to retrieve a single snapshot of paid data. Each snapshot costs $0.01.  
See [here] for more information about Regulatory Snapshots and Market Data.

**mktDataOptions:** List\<TagValue>. Internal use only.

---
title: Market Data Update Frequency
---
Watchlist market data at Interactive Brokers is derived from time-based snapshot intervals which vary by product and region. This means that a given tick will only update as frequently as its interval allows. See the table for more details on product specifics.

| Product | Frequency |
| --- | --- |
| United States | |
| Stocks, Futures, Bonds, Indices | 250ms |
| Options | 100ms |
| Forex | 5ms |
| Europe | |
| All Products | 250ms |
| Asia | |
| All Products | 250ms |



---
title: Generic Tick Types
---
The most common tick types are delivered automatically after a successful market data request. There are however other tick types available by explicit request: the generic tick types. When invoking IBApi.EClient.reqMktData, specific generic ticks can be requested via the genericTickList parameter of the function:

See the [Available Tick Types](#available-tick-types) section for more information on generic ticks.



---
title: Streaming Data Snapshots
---
With an exchange market data subscription, such as Network A (NYSE), Network B(ARCA), or Network C(NASDAQ) for US stocks, it is possible to request a snapshot of the current state of the market once instead of requesting a stream of updates continuously as market values change. By invoking the EClient.reqMktData function passing in true for the snapshot parameter, the client application will receive the currently available market data once before a EWrapper.tickSnapshotEnd event is sent 11 seconds later. Snapshot requests can only be made for the default tick types; no generic ticks can be specified. It is important to note that a snapshot request will only return available data over the 11 second span; in some cases values may not be returned for all tick types.

#### EWrapper.tickSnapshotEnd (

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.  
)

When requesting market data snapshots, this market will indicate the snapshot reception is finished. Expected to occur 11 seconds after beginning of request.

title: Regulatory Snapshots
---
The fifth argument to reqMktData specifies a regulatory snapshot request to US stocks and options.

For stocks, there are individual exchange-specific market data subscriptions necessary to receive streaming quotes. For instance, for NYSE stocks this subscription is known as "Network A", for ARCA/AMEX stocks it is called "Network B" and for NASDAQ stocks it is "Network C". Each subscription is added a la carte and has a separate market data fee.

Alternatively, there is also a "US Securities Snapshot Bundle" subscription which does not provide streaming data but which allows for real time calculated snapshots of US market NBBO prices. By setting the 5th parameter in the function EClient::reqMktData to **True**, a regulatory snapshot request can be made from the API. The returned value is a calculation of the current market state based on data from all available exchanges.

**Important: Each regulatory snapshot made will incur a fee of 0.01 USD to the account. This applies to both live *and* paper accounts.**. If the monthly fee for regulatory snapshots reaches the price of a particular 'Network' subscription, the user will automatically be subscribed to that Network subscription for continuous streaming quotes and charged the associated fee for that month. At the end of the month the subscription will be terminated. Each listing exchange will be capped independently and will not be combined across listing exchanges.

Requesting regulatory snapshots is subject to pacing limitations:

* No more than one request per second.

The following table lists the cost and maximum allocation for regulatory snapshot quotes:

| Listed Network Feed | Price per reqSnapshot request | Pro or non-Pro | Max reqSnapshot request |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NYSE (Network A/CTA) | 0.01 USD | Pro | 4500 |
| NYSE (Network A/CTA) | 0.01 USD | Non-Pro | 150 |
| AMEX (Network B/CTA) | 0.01 USD | Pro | 2300 |
| AMEX (Network B/CTA) | 0.01 USD | Non-Pro | 150 |
| NASDAQ (Network C/UTP) | 0.01 USD | Pro | 2300 |
| NASDAQ (Network C/UTP) | 0.01 USD | Non-Pro | 150 |

title: Receive Live Data

**Note:** Please be aware that in the event subsequent orders are received with the same price value, but different size values, no new tickPrice value should be returned. Only an updated tickSize will denote that a new order was retrieved with the assumption the last tickPrice value will also correlate with the new size.

title: Exchange Component Mapping
---
A market data request is able to return data from multiple exchanges. After a market data request is made for an instrument covered by market data subscriptions, a message will be sent to function IBApi::EWrapper::tickReqParams with information about 'minTick', BBO exchange mapping, and available snapshot permissions.

The exchange mapping identifier bboExchange will be a symbol such as "a6" which can be used to decode the single letter exchange abbreviations returned to the bidExch, askExch, and lastExch fields by invoking the function IBApi::EClient::reqSmartComponents. More information about Component Exchanges.

The minTick returned to tickReqParams indicates the minimum increment in market data values returned to the API. It can differ from the minTick value in the ContractDetails class. For instance, combos will often have a minimum increment of 0.01 for market data and a minTick of 0.05 for order placement.

#### EWrapper.tickReqParams (

**tickerId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

**minTick:** Minimum tick for the contract on the exchange.

**bboExchange:** String. Exchange offering the best bid offer.

**snapshotPermissions:** Based on the snapshot parameter in EClient.reqMktData.  
)

Displays the ticker with BBO exchange.

title: Re-Routing CFDs
---
IB does not provide market data for certain types of instruments, such as stock CFDs and forex CFDs. If a stock CFD or forex CFD is entered into a TWS watchlist, TWS will automatically display market data for the underlying ticker and show a 'U' icon next to the instrument name to indicate that the data is for the underlying instrument.

From the API, when level 1 or level 2 market data is requested for a stock CFD or a forex CFD, a callback is made to the functions EWrapper.rerouteMktDataReq or EWrapper.rerouteMktDepthReq respectively with details about the underlying instrument in IB's database which does have market data.

#### EWrapper.rerouteMktDataReq (

**reqId:** int. Request identifier used to track data.

title: Halted
---
The Halted tick type indicates if a contract has been halted for trading. It can have the following values:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| -1 | Halted status not available. Usually returned with frozen data. |
| 0 | Not halted. This value will **only** be returned if the contract is in a TWS watchlist. |
| 1 | General halt. Trading halt is imposed for purely regulatory reasons with/without volatility halt. |
| 2 | Volatility halt. Trading halt is imposed by the exchange to protect against extreme volatility. |



---
title: Shortable
---
The shortable tick is an indicative on the amount of shares which can be sold short for the contract:

For detailed information about shortability data (shortable shares, fee rate) available outside of TWS, see [Short Securities Availability](/en/trading/short-securities-availability.php)

| Range | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Value higher than 2.5 | There are at least 1000 shares available for short selling. |
| Value higher than 1.5 | This contract will be available for short selling if shares can be located. |
| 1.5 or less | Contract is not available for short selling. |



---
title: Volume Data
---
The API reports the current day's volume in several ways. They are summarized as follows:

* Volume tick type 8: The 'native volume'. This includes delayed transactions, busted trades, and combos, but will not update with every tick.
* RTVolume: highest number, includes non-reportable trades such as odd lots, average price and derivative trades.
* RTTradeVolume: only includes 'last' ticks, similar to number also used in charts/historical data.



---
title: RT Volume
---
The RT Volume tick type corresponds to the TWS' Time & Sales window and contains the last trade's price, size and time along with current day's total traded volume, Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and whether or not the trade was filled by a single market maker.

There is a setting in TWS which displays tick-by-tick data in the TWS Time & Sales Window. If this setting is checked, it will provide a higher granularity of data than RTVolume.

Example: 701.28;1;1348075471534;67854;701.46918464;true

As volume for US stocks is reported in lots, a volume of 0 reported in RTVolume will typically indicate an odd lot data point (less than 100 shares).

It is important to note that while the TWS Time & Sales Window also has information about trade conditions available with data points, this data is not available through the API. So for instance, the 'unreportable' trade status displayed with points in the Time & Sales Window is not available through the API, and that trade data will appear in the API just as any other data point. As always, an API application needs to exercise caution in responding to single data points.

**Note:** Please be aware that RT Volume is not supported with Cryptocurrencies.

RT Trade Volume

The RT Trade Volume is similar to RT Volume, but designed to avoid relaying back "Unreportable Trades" shown in TWS Time&Sales via the API. RT Trade Volume will not contain average price or derivative trades which are included in RTVolume.



---
title: IB Dividends
---
This tick type provides four different comma-separated elements:

* The sum of dividends for the past 12 months (0.83 in the example below).
* The sum of dividends for the next 12 months (0.92 from the example below).
* The next dividend date (20130219 in the example below).
* The next single dividend amount (0.23 from the example below).

**Example:**0.83,0.92,20130219,0.23

To receive dividend information it is sometimes necessary to direct-route rather than smart-route market data requests.



---
title: Introduction
---
In TWS, tick-by-tick data is available in the Time & Sales Window.

The maximum number of simultaneous tick-by-tick subscriptions allowed for a user is 5% of the user's total market data lines. See [Specialized Market Data Lines] for more information.

* Real time tick-by-tick data is currently not available for options. Historical tick-by-tick data is available.
* The tick type field is case sensitive – it must be BidAsk, Last, AllLast, MidPoint. AllLast has additional trade types such as combos, derivatives, and average price trades which are not included in Last.
* Tick-by-tick data for options is currently only available historically and not in real time.
* Tick-by-tick data for indices is only provided for indices which are on CME.
* Tick-by-tick data is not available for combos.
* No more than 1 tick-by-tick request can be made for the same instrument within 15 seconds.
* Time & Sales data requires a Level 1, Top Of Book market data subscription. This would be the same subscription as [EClient.reqMktData()\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/top-of-book-l-1/request-watchlist-data) or [EClient.reqHistoricalData()\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-historical/historical-bars/requesting-historical-bars).

title: Request Tick By Tick Data
---
#### EClient.reqTickByTickData (

**reqId:** int. unique identifier of the request.

**contract:** Contract. the contract for which tick-by-tick data is requested.

**tickType:** String. tick-by-tick data type: "Last", "AllLast", "BidAsk" or "MidPoint".

**numberOfTicks:** int. If a non-zero value is entered, then historical tick data is first returned via one of the  [Historical Time and Sales Ewrapper Methods\](/tws-api/doc/market-data-live/tick-by-tick-data/receive-tick-by-tick-data)  respectively. (Max number of historical Ticks is 1000)

**ignoreSize:** bool. Omit updates that reflect only changes in size, and not price. *Applicable to Bid\_Ask data requests*.  
)

Requests tick by tick or Time & Sales data.

Note:

The maximum number of simultaneous tick-by-tick subscriptions allowed for a user is 5% of the user's total market data lines. See [Specialized Market Data Lines] for more information.

The Tick-By-Tick attribute has been introduced. The tick attribute *pastLimit* is also returned with historical Tick-By-Tick responses.

* If tick has zero price, zero size and pastLimit flag is set – this is "Halted" tick.
* If tick has zero price, zero size and followed immediately after "Halted" tick – this is "Unhalted" tick.

title: Introduction

Some scans in the TWS Advanced Market Scanner can be accessed via the TWS API through the EClient.reqScannerSubscription.

Results are delivered via EWrapper.scannerData and the EWrapper.scannerDataEnd marker will indicate when all results have been delivered. The returned results to scannerData simply consist of a list of contracts. There are no market data fields (bid, ask, last, volume, …) returned from the scanner, and so if these are desired they have to be requested separately with the reqMktData function. Since the scanner results do not include any market data fields, it is not necessary to have market data subscriptions to use the API scanner. However to use filters, market data subscriptions are generally required.

Since the EClient.reqScannerSubscription request keeps a subscription open you will keep receiving periodic updates until the request is cancelled via EClient.cancelScannerSubscription :

Scans are limited to a maximum result of 50 results per scan code, and only 10 API scans can be active at a time.

scannerSubscriptionFilterOptions has been added to the API to allow for generic filters. This field is entered as a list of TagValues which have a tag followed by its value, e.g. TagValue("usdMarketCapAbove", "10000") indicates a market cap above 10000 USD. Available filters can be found using the EClient.reqScannerParameters function.

A string containing all available XML-formatted parameters will then be returned via EWrapper.scannerParameters.

**Important:** remember the TWS API is just an interface to the TWS. If you are having problems defining a scanner, always make sure you can create a similar scanner using the TWS' [Advanced Market Scanner](https://ibkrguides.com/tws/usersguidebook/mosaic/advancedscanner.htm).

title: Introduction

API news requires news subscriptions that are specific to the API; most news services in TWS are not also available in the API. There are three API news services enabled in accounts by default and available from the API. They are:

* Briefing.com General Market Columns (BRFG)
* Briefing.com Analyst Actions (BRFUPDN)
* Dow Jones Newsletters (DJNL)

There are also four additional news services available with all TWS versions which require **API-specific subscriptions** to first be made in Account Management. They have different data fees than the subscription for the same news in TWS-only. As with all subscriptions, they only apply to the specific TWS username under which they were made:

* Briefing Trader (BRF)
* Benzinga Pro (BZ)
* Fly on the Wall (FLY)

The API functions which handle news are able to query available news provides, subscribe to news in real time to receive headlines as they are released, request specific news articles, and return a historical list of news stories that are cached in the system.



---
title: Introduction
---
Adding or removing API news subscriptions from an account is accomplished through Account Management. From the API, currently subscribed news sources can be retrieved using the function IBApi::EClient::reqNewsProviders. A list of available subscribed news sources is returned to the function IBApi::EWrapper::newsProviders

**Important:** in order to obtain news feeds via the TWS API you need to acquire the relevant API-specific subscriptions via your Account Management.

News articles provided through the API may not correspond to what is available directly through the Trader Workstation. Off-platform distribution of data is at the discretion of the news source provider, not by Interactive Brokers.

When invoking IBApi.EClient.reqMktData, for a specific IBApi.Contract you will follow the same format convention as any other basic contracts. The News Source is identified by the genericTickList argument.

**Note:** The error message "invalid tick type" will be returned if the username has not added the appropriate API news subscription.

****Note**:** For Briefing Trader live head lines via the API is only offered on a case-by-case basis directly from Briefing.com offers Briefing Trader subscribers access to the subscription live head lines via the API. For more information and to submit an API entitlement application, please contact Briefing.com directly at [dbeasley@briefing.com](https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/news.html#).

title: Introduction

The nextValidId event provides the next valid identifier needed to place an order. It is necessary to use an order ID with new orders which is greater than all previous order IDs used to place an order. While requests such as EClient.reqMktData will not increment the minimum request ID value, more than one market data request cannot use the same request ID at the same time.

The nextValidId value may be queried on each request. However, it is often recommended to make a request once at the beginning of the session, and then locally increment the value for each request.

title: Reset Order ID Sequence
---
The next valid identifier is persistent between TWS sessions.

If necessary, you can reset the order ID sequence within the API Settings dialogue. Note however that the order sequence Id can only be reset if there are no active API orders.

---
title: ClientId 0 and the Master Client ID
---
Each TWS API connection maintains its own ClientID to the host through the EClient.connect function. There are two unique client ID behaviors developers must be aware of:

* **Master ClientID:** The Master Client ID is set in the Global Configuration and is used to distinguish the connecting Client ID used to pull order and trades data even from other API connections. Connecting without using the Master Client ID will mean only trades on the connected Client ID will be returning from calls to the openOrder or execDetails functions.
* **ClientID 0:** ClientID 0 is unique from the rest of the client IDs in that users can receive trades made through Trader Workstation or through FIX in addition to trades that take place on the current client ID.

The Master ClientID value can be assigned to 0 so that a connection can retrieve orders placed from TWS, FIX sessions, and all API connections on the account.

![Highlights the "Master API client ID" setting under API Settings.](file:docs/assets/media/master_client_id.png)



---
title: Commission And Fees Report
---
When an order is filled either fully or partially, the [IBApi.EWrapper.execDetails](#exec-details) and IBApi.EWrapper.commissionReport events will deliver [IBApi.Execution](#exec-details) and IBApi.CommissionAndFeesReport objects. This allows to obtain the full picture of the order's execution and the resulting commissions.

* Advisors executing allocation orders will receive execution details and commissions for the allocation order itself. To receive allocation details and commissions for a specific subaccount [IBApi.EClient.reqExecutions\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/execution-details/request-execution-details) can be used.

#### EWrapper.commissionReport (

**commissionAndFeesReport:** [CommissionAndFeesReport](/ibkr-api-page/twsapi-ref/#commreport-ref). Returns a commissions report object containing the fields execId, commission, currency, realizedPnl, yield, and yieldRedemptionDate.

---
title: Introduction
---
IBApi.Execution and IBApi.CommissionReport can be requested on demand via the IBApi.EClient.reqExecutions method which receives a IBApi.ExecutionFilter object as parameter to obtain only those executions matching the given criteria. An empty IBApi.ExecutionFilter object can be passed to obtain all previous executions.

Once all matching executions have been delivered, an IBApi.EWrapper.execDetailsEnd event will be triggered.

Important: By default, only those executions occurring since midnight for that particular account will be delivered. If you want to request executions from the last 7 days, TWS's Trade Log setting "Show trades for …" must be adjusted to your requirement. The IB Gateway is limited to only executions from the current trading day since midnight.



---
title: ExecID Behavior
---
If a correction to an execution is published it will be received as an additional IBApi.EWrapper.execDetails callback with all parameters identical except for the execID in the Execution object. The execID will differ only in the digits after the final period.

By default, most ExecID values will return as 4-segment alphanumeric sequence to identify each unique order. In the case of Combo orders, you may encounter a 5-segment alphanumeric sequence which will be used to denote per-leg executions. As an example, if a 1:1 combo for 200 shares of both contracts is placed, the first leg may fill for 200 shares, then leg 2 may fill for 100 in one execution, and then another execution for leg 2 of 100. The fifth segment will distinguish between these unique inner-combo executions.



---
title: The Execution Object
---
The Execution object is used to maintain all data related to a user's traded orders. This can be used in both querying execution details and navigating received data. The details provided will display all information pertaining to the execution, including how many shares were filled, the price of the execution, and what time it took place.

#### Execution()

**OrderId:** int. The API client's order Id. May not be unique to an account.

**ClientId:** int. The API client identifier which placed the order which originated this execution.

**ExecId:** String. The execution's identifier. Each partial fill has a separate ExecId. A correction is indicated by an ExecId which differs from a previous ExecId in only the digits after the final period, e.g. an ExecId ending in ".02" would be a correction of a previous execution with an ExecId ending in ".01".

**Time:** String. The execution's server time.

**AcctNumber:** String. The account to which the order was allocated.

**Exchange:** String. The exchange where the execution took place.

**Side:** String. Specifies if the transaction was buy or sale BOT for bought, SLD for sold.

**Shares:** decimal. The number of shares filled.

**Price:** double. The order's execution price excluding commissions.

**PermId:** int. The TWS order identifier. The PermId can be 0 for trades originating outside IB.

**Liquidation:** int. Identifies whether an execution occurred because of an IB-initiated liquidation.

**CumQty:** decimal. Cumulative quantity. Used in regular trades, combo trades and legs of the combo.

**AvgPrice:** double. Average price. Used in regular trades, combo trades and legs of the combo. Does not include commissions.

**OrderRef:** String. The OrderRef is a user-customizable string that can be set from the API or TWS and will be associated with an order for its lifetime.

**EvRule:** String. The Economic Value Rule name and the respective optional argument. The two values should be separated by a colon. For example, aussieBond:YearsToExpiration=3. When the optional argument is not present, the first value will be followed by a colon.

**EvMultiplier:** double. Tells you approximately how much the market value of a contract would change if the price were to change by 1. It cannot be used to get market value by multiplying the price by the approximate multiplier.

**ModelCode:** String. model code

**LastLiquidity:** Liquidity. The liquidity type of the execution.

**pendingPriceRevision:** bool. Describes if the execution is still pending price revision.

Given additional structures for executions are ever evolving, it is recommended to review the relevant Execution class in your programming language for a comprehensive review of what fields are available.

title: Understanding Order Status Message
---
###### 

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Inactive | Indicates that you are in the process of creating an order and you have not yet activated or transmitted it. |
| PendingSubmit | Indicates that you have transmitted your order, but have not yet received confirmation that it has been accepted by the order destination. |
| PreSubmitted | Indicates that an order has been accepted by the system (simulated orders) or an exchange (native orders) and that this order has yet to be elected. |
| Submitted | Indicates that your order has been accepted and is working at the destination. |
| Filled | Order has been completely filled. |
| PendingCancel | Indicates that you have sent a request to cancel the order but have not yet received cancel confirmation from the order destination. At this point, your order is not confirmed canceled. You may still receive an execution while your cancellation request is pending. |
| PreCancelled | Indicates that a cancellation request has been accepted by the system but that currently the request is not being recognized, due to system, exchange or other issues. At this point, your order is not confirmed canceled. You may still receive an execution while your cancellation request is pending. |
| Cancelled | Indicates that the balance of your order has been confirmed canceled by the system. This could occur unexpectedly when the destination has rejected your order. |
| WarnState | Order has a specific warning message such as for basket orders. |

title: Introduction
---
As long as an order is active, it is possible to retrieve it using the TWS API. Orders submitted via the TWS API will always be bound to the client application (i.e. client Id) they were submitted from meaning only the submitting client will be able to modify the placed order. Three different methods are provided to allow for maximum flexibility. Active orders will be returned via the [IBApi.EWrapper.openOrder](/tws-api/doc/order-management/open-orders) and [IBApi.EWrapper.orderStatus](/tws-api/#order-status) methods as already described in [The openOrder callback\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/open-orders) and [The orderStatus callback](/tws-api/doc/order-management/order-status/introduction) sections

**Note:** it is not possible to obtain cancelled or fully filled orders.



---
title: API client's orders
---
The IBApi.EClient.reqOpenOrders method allows to obtain all active orders submitted by the client application connected with the exact same client Id with which the order was sent to the TWS. If client 0 invokes reqOpenOrders, it will cause currently open orders placed from TWS manually to be 'bound', i.e. assigned an order ID so that they can be modified or cancelled by the API client 0.

When an order is bound by API client 0 there will be callback to IBApi::EWrapper::orderBound. This indicates the mapping between API order ID and permID. The [IBApi.EWrapper.orderBound](#order-bound-notification) callback in response to newly bound orders that indicates the mapping between the permID (unique account-wide) and API Order ID (specific to an API client). In the API settings in Global Configuration, is a setting checked by default "Use negative numbers to bind automatic orders" which will specify how manual TWS orders are assigned an API order ID.

Because binding the order will change the order ID, this function will be rejected when used with the API Read-Only Mode enabled. You can find the steps for disabling read-only mode at in [TWS Settings\](/tws-api/doc/tws-settings/tws-configuration-for-api-use/introduction).

#### EClient.reqOpenOrders ()

Requests all open orders places by this specific API client (identified by the API client id). For client ID 0, this will bind previous manual TWS orders.

title: The Order and Contract Objects
---
The order object is an essential piece of the TWS API which is used to both place and manage orders. This is primarily built with an ever increasing range of attributes used to create the best order possible. With that being said, the value to the right represents the required fields in order to place or reference any order. Keep in mind that there are several other attributes that can and should be referenced.

#### Order()

**action:** String. Determines whether the contract should be a BUY or SELL.

**auxPrice:** double. Used to determine the stop price for STP, STP LMT, and TRAIL orders.

**lmtPrice:** double. Used to determine the limit price for LMT, STP LMT, and TRAIL orders.

**orderType:** String. Specify the type of order to place. For example, MKT, LMT, STP.

**tif:** String. Time in force for the order. Default tif is DAY.

**totalQuantity:** decimal. Total size of the order.

Given additional structures for orders are ever evolving, it is recommended to review the relevant order class in your programming language for a comprehensive review of what fields are available.

<Button text="Order Class Reference" intent="primary" href="/tws-api/ref/order-class-reference/introduction" large={true}>
  Order Class Reference
</Button>

Another essential piece is Contract object. The contract object is used to describe a financial instrument to TWS. When passed to placeOrder() method, TWS attempts to match the provided fields to a single unique instrument in it's database and routes the order to the exchange defined in 'exchange' field.

Futures and options require additional fields like lastTradeDateOrContractMonth, strike, right and multiplier to be added for successfull contract identification.

#### Contract()

**symbol:** String. Ticker symbol of the instrument.

**secType:** String. Security type.

**exchange:** String. Routing exchange.

**currency:** String. Currency denomination.

**primaryExchange:** String. Listing exchange.

Review the relevant order class in your programming language for a comprehensive review of what fields are available.

An order can be cancelled from the API with the functions EClient.cancelOrder and EClient::reqGlobalCancel.

EClient.cancelOrder can only be used to cancel an order that was placed originally by a client with the same client ID (or from TWS for client ID 0).

EClient.reqGlobalCancel will cancel all open orders, regardless of how they were originally placed.



---
title: Cancel Individual Order
---
#### EClient.cancelOrder (

**orderId:** int. Specify which order should be cancelled by its identifier.

**orderCancel:** orderCancel. An OrderCancel object that can receive the manualOrderCancelTime, manualOrderIndicator, and extOperator fields. See OrderCancel Reference for more insight on the OrderCancel class.  
)

Cancels an active order placed by from the same API client ID.

**Note:** API clients cannot cancel individual orders placed by other clients. Only reqGlobalCancel is available.

title: Exercise Options
---
Options are exercised or lapsed from the API with the function EClient.exerciseOptions.

* Option exercise will appear with order status side = "BUY" and limit price of 0, but only at the time the request is made
* Option exercise can be distinguished by price = 0

#### EClient.exerciseOptions (

**tickerId:** int. Exercise request's identifier

**contract:** Contract. the option Contract to be exercised.

**exerciseAction:** int. Set to 1 to exercise the option, set to 2 to let the option lapse.

**exerciseQuantity:** int. Number of contracts to be exercised

**account:** String. Destination account

**ovrd:** int. Specifies whether your setting will override the system's natural action.  
Set to 1 to override, set to 0 not to.

For example, if your action is "exercise" and the option is not in-the-money, by natural action the option would not exercise. If you have override set to "yes" the natural action would be overridden and the out-of-the money option would be exercised.

**manualOrderTime:** String. Specify the time at which the options should be exercised. An empty string will assume the current time.  
Required TWS API 10.26 or higher.  
)

Exercises an options contract.

**Note:** this function is affected by a TWS setting which specifies if an exercise request must be finalized.

title: Introduction
---
The minimum increment is the minimum difference between price levels at which a contract can trade. Some trades have constant price increments at all price levels. However some contracts have difference minimum increments on different exchanges on which they trade and/or different minimum increments at different price levels. In the contractDetails class, there is a field 'minTick' which specifies the smallest possible minimum increment encountered on any exchange or price. For complete information about minimum price increment structure, there is the IB Contracts and Securities search site, or the API function EClient.reqMarketRule.

The function [EClient.reqContractDetails](#request-contract-details) when used with a Contract object will return contractDetails object to the contractDetails function which has a list of the valid exchanges where the instrument trades. Also within the contractDetails object is a field called marketRuleIDs which has a list of "market rules". A market rule is defined as a rule which defines the minimum price increment given the price. The market rule list returned in contractDetails has a list of market rules in the same order as the list of valid exchanges. In this way, the market rule ID for a contract on a particular exchange can be determined.

* Market rule for forex and forex CFDs indicates default configuration (1/2 and not 1/10 pips). It can be adjusted to 1/10 pips through TWS or IB Gateway Global Configuration.
* Some non-US securities, for instance on the SEHK exchange, have a minimum lot size. This information is not available from the API but can be obtained from the IB Contracts and Securities search page. It will also be indicated in the error message returned from an order which does not conform to the minimum lot size.

With the market rule ID number, the corresponding rule can be found with the API function EClient.reqMarketRule. The rule is returned to the function EWrapper.marketRule.

* For forex, there is an option in TWS/IB Gateway configuration which allows trading in 1/10 pips instead of 1/5 pips (the default).
* TWS Global Configuration -> Display -> Ticker Row -> Allow Forex trading in 1/10 pips



---
title: Request Market Rule
---
#### EClient.reqMarketRule (

**marketRuleId**: int. The id of market rule  
)

Requests details about a given market rule. The market rule for an instrument on a particular exchange provides details about how the minimum price increment changes with price.

A list of market rule ids can be obtained by invoking [EClient.reqContractDetails\](/tws-api/doc/contracts-financial-instruments/contract-details/request-contract-details) on a particular contract. The returned market rule ID list will provide the market rule ID for the instrument in the correspond valid exchange list in contractDetails.

title: MiFIR Transaction Reporting Fields
---
For EEA investment firms required to comply with MiFIR reporting, and who have opted in to Enriched and Delegated Transaction Reporting, we have added four new order attributes to the Order class, and several new presets to TWS and IB Gateway Global Configuration.

New order attributes include:

* **IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionMaker** – Used to send "investment decision within the firm" value (if IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionAlgo is not used).
* **IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionAlgo** – Used to send "investment decision within the firm" value (if IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionMaker is not used).
* **IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionTrader** – Used to send "execution within the firm" value (if IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionAlgo is not used).
* **IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionAlgo** – Used to send "execution within the firm" value (if IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionTrader is not used).

New TWS and IB Gateway Order Presets can be found in the Orders > MiFIR page of Global Configuration, and include TWS Decision-Maker Defaults, API Decision-Maker Defaults, and Executing Trader/Algo presets.

The following choices are available for the "investment decision within the firm" IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionMaker and IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionAlgo attributes:

1. This field does not need to be reported if you are:
   * Using the TWS API to transmit orders, AND
   * The investment decision is always made by the client, AND
   * None of these clients are an EEA investment firm with delegated reporting selected (the "delegated reporting firm").

   You can configure the preset to indicate this via TWS Global Configuration using the Orders > MiFIR page. In this scenario, the orders for the proprietary account will need to be placed via TWS.
2. If you are using the TWS API to transmit orders, and the investment decision is made by a person, or a group of people within a delegated reporting firm, with one person being the primary decision maker:
   * Your TWS API program can, on each order, transmit a decision maker's IB-assigned short code using the field IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionMaker. You can define persons who can be the decision-makers via IB Account Management. To obtain the short codes that IB assigned to those persons, please contact IB Client Services.
   * If your TWS API program is unable to transmit the above field, and the investment decision is either made by, or approved by, a single person who can be deemed to be the primary investment decision maker, you can pre-configure a default investment decision-maker that will be used for orders where the above fields are not present. You must define the investment decision-maker(s) in IB Account Management, and can then configure the default investment decision-maker in TWS Global Configuration using the Orders > MiFIR page.
3. If you are using the TWS API to transmit orders and the investment decision is made by an algorithm:
   * Your TWS API program can, on each order, transmit a decision maker's IB-assigned short code using the field IBApi.Order.Mifid2DecisionAlgo. You can define algorithms that can be the decision-makers via IB Account Management. To obtain the short codes that IB assigned to those persons, please contact IB Client Services.
   * If your TWS API program is unable to transmit the above field, and/or the investment decision is made by a single or primary decision-maker algorithm, you can pre-configure a default investment decision-maker algo that will be used for orders where the above field is not sent. You must define the investment decision-maker(s) in IB Account Management, and can then configure the default investment decision-maker in TWS Global Configuration using the Orders > MiFIR page.

     *NOTE: Only ONE investment decision-maker, either a primary person or algorithm, should be provided on an order, or selected as the default.*

The following choices are available for "execution within the firm" IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionTrader and IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionAlgo attributes:

1. No additional information is needed if you are using the TWS API to transmit orders entered in a third-party trading interface, and you are the trader responsible for execution within the firm.
2. If your TWS API program transmits orders to IB automatically without human intervention, please contact **IB Client Services** to register the program or programs with IB as an algo. Only the primary program or algo needs to be registered and identified. You can then configure the default in TWS Global Configuration using the Orders > MiFIR page.
3. Your TWS API program, on each order, can transmit the IB-assigned short code of the algo or person responsible for execution within the firm using the field IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionAlgo (for the algorithm) or IBApi.Order.Mifid2ExecutionTrader (for the person).

For more information, or to obtain short codes for persons or algos defined in IB Account Management, please contact IB Client Services.

To find out more about the MiFIR transaction reporting obligations, see the [MiFIR Enriched and Delegated Transaction Reporting for EEA Investment Firms](https://ibkr.info/node/2975) knowledge base article.

title: Modifying Orders
---
Modification of an API order can be done if the API client is connected to a session of TWS with the same username of TWS and using the same API client ID. The function [EClient.placeOrder](#place-order) can then be called with the same fields as the open order, except for the parameter to modify. This includes the Order.OrderId, which must match the Order.OrderId of the **open** order. It is not generally recommended to try to change order fields aside from order price, size, and tif (for DAY -> IOC modifications). To change other parameters, it might be preferable to instead cancel the open order, and create a new one.

* To modify or cancel an individual order placed manually from TWS, it is necessary to connect with client ID 0 and then bind the order before attempting to modify it. The process of binding assigns the order an API order ID; prior to binding it will be returned to the API with an **API order ID of 0**. Orders with API order ID 0 cannot be modified/cancelled from the API. The function reqOpenOrders binds orders open at that moment which do not already have an API order ID, and the function reqAutoOpenOrders binds future orders automatically. The function reqAllOpenOrders does not bind orders.
* To modify API orders when connecting to a different session of TWS (logged in with a different username than used for the original order), it is necessary to first bind the order with client ID 0 in the same manner as manual TWS orders are bound before they can be modified. The binding assignment of API order IDs is independent for each TWS user, so the same order can have different API order IDs for different users. The permID returned in the API Order class which is assigned by TWS can be used to identify an order in an account uniquely.
* The process of order binding from the API cancels/resubmits an order working on an exchange. This may affect the order's place in the exchange queue. Enhancements are planned to allow for API binding with modification of exchange queue priority.



---
title: Introduction
---
Orders are submitted via the EClient.placeOrder method.

Immediately after an order is submitted correctly, the TWS will start sending events concerning the order's activity via [EWrapper.openOrder\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/open-orders) and [EWrapper.orderStatus\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/order-status/introduction)

Advisors executing allocation orders will receive execution details and commissions for the allocation order itself. To receive allocation details and commissions for a specific subaccount [EClient.reqExecutions\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/execution-details/request-execution-details) can be used.

An order can be sent to TWS but not transmitted to the IB server by setting the Order.Transmit flag in the order class to False. Untransmitted orders will only be available within that TWS session (not for other usernames) and will be cleared on restart. Also, they can be cancelled or transmitted from the API but not viewed while they remain in the "untransmitted" state.

#### EClient.placeOrder (

**id:** int. The order's unique identifier. If a new order is placed with an order ID less than or equal to the order ID of a previous order an error will occur.

**contract:** Contract. The order's contract

**order:** Order. The order object.  
)

Places or modifies an order.

title: Adding a Profit Taker and Stop Loss
---
Users are able to bracket their order in two distinct ways:

* Manually construct each child of the parent. See Bracket Orders for more details.
* Adding child orders based on TWS Presets.

Adding a profit taker and stop loss from the same order object automated the order bracket process so that only order ID needs to be provided. This is best for users looking to trade with identical bracket parameters across orders.

#### Profit Taker

A profit taker can be added to an order using the `ptOrderId` and `ptOrderType` Order attributes.

**PtOrderId** must be a unique order identifier.  
Consider using [EWrapper.NextValidId\](/tws-api/doc/next-valid-id/introduction)

**PtOrderType** must always be set to "PRESET".  
Be sure to review your [Presets in Trader Workstation](/en/?f=%2Fen%2Ftrading%2Ftws-order-presets.php) prior to submitting orders as the Profit taker details will mirror these details as set.

```
order = Order()
order.orderId = 10000
order.action = "BUY"
order.orderType = "LMT"
order.totalQuantity = 100
order.lmtPrice = 256
order.tif = "DAY"

order.ptOrderType = "PRESET"
order.ptOrderId = 10001
```

#### Stop Loss

A stop loss can be added to an order using the `slOrderId` and `slOrderType` Order attributes.

**SlOrderId** must be a unique order identifier.  
Consider using [EWrapper.NextValidId\](/tws-api/doc/next-valid-id/introduction)

**SlOrderType** must always be set to "PRESET".  
Be sure to review your [Presets in Trader Workstation](/en/?f=%2Fen%2Ftrading%2Ftws-order-presets.php) prior to submitting orders as the Stop loss details will mirror these details as set.

```
order = Order()
order.orderId = 10000
order.action = "BUY"
order.orderType = "LMT"
order.totalQuantity = 100
order.lmtPrice = 256
order.tif = "DAY"

order.slOrderType = "PRESET"
order.slOrderId = 10002
```



---
title: Combo Orders
---
A user may create an order for a combination of symbols, referred to as a Spread or Combo, by the use of a Spread Contract.

Spreads may be priced on a per-leg basis or a complete order.

* Combo orders may only use price-per-leg on with two legs in a Non-Guaranteed spread.
* Combo orders with more than 2 legs may only be placed with a price for the overall order and must not be NonGuaranteed.

#### Combo Price Per Leg

Combination orders may be priced per-leg with no more than 2 legs in a [NonGuaranteed](/lib/cstools/faq/#/content/1163249841) order. This is accomplished with the OrderComboLeg class and defining a price in each object. The OrderComboLeg should then be added to the Order object's OrderComboLegs attribute in an array.

```
order = Order()
order.orderType = "LMT"

orderLeg1 = OrderComboLeg()
orderLeg1.price = 222

orderLeg2 = OrderComboLeg()
orderLeg2.price = 333

order.orderComboLegs = [orderLeg2, orderLeg1]
```

#### Price Overall Order

To price an overall order, users would only need to define the lmtPrice or auxPrice values within the Order object as they would if trading an individual contract.

```
order = Order()
order.orderType = "LMT"
order.lmtPrice = 555
```



---
title: Trading The Overnight Session
---
In the event a user would like to designate a trade to take place during the Overnight trading hours, the Order object must set 'includeOvernight' set to True and optionally set the 'exchange' field of Contract object to OVERNIGHT.

#### Routing exclusively to the Overnight market

Users that would like to route orders to [Overnight](/en/trading/ordertypes.php?m=overnightTradingModal) without trading during the regular session must set the Order Object's 'includeOvernight' value as True and designate the 'exchange' value of a Contract object as "OVERNIGHT".

```
contract = Contract()
contract.exchange = "OVERNIGHT"

order = Order()
order.includeOvernight = True
```

#### Routing as Overnight+DAY

Users that would like to route orders to [Overnight+DAY](/en/trading/ordertypes.php?m=overnightSmartModal) to trade during the day and the overnight session must set the Order Object's includeOvernight value as True and designate the exchange value as "SMART".

```
contract = Contract()
contract.exchange = "SMART"

order = Order()
order.includeOvernight = True
```



---
title: Understanding Order Precautions
---
By default, the Trader Workstation implements several precautionary settings that will notify customers of potential order risks to make sure users are well informed before transmitting orders. As a result, customers will typically need to acknowledge a precautionary message and manually transmit the orders through the Trader Workstation. These precautionary messages may be disabled if the user is comfortable and aware of the behavior they are disabling.

### Disabling Warning Messages

1. Log in to the Trader Workstation
2. Open the Global Configuration by selecting the Cog Wheel icon in the top right corner
3. Navigate to the "Messages" section on the left.
4. **Carefully read each message before disabling it**. You can then disable the warning by unchecking the box on the right of the message description.

### Modifying Precautionary Settings

1. Log in to the Trader Workstation
2. Open the Global Configuration by selecting the Cog Wheel icon in the top right corner
3. Navigate to the "Presets" section on the left
4. Select the instrument(s) you are trading
5. **Carefully read each setting before making changes to it.**You may modify the values inside the "Precautionary Settings" settings to be more or less restrictive. You may also set the value to '0' to disable the precaution entirely.



---
title: Order Placement Considerations
---
When placing orders via the API and building a robust trading system, it is important to monitor for callback notifications, specifically for **[IBApi::EWrapper::error\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/receiving-error-messages)**, [**IBApi:**:**EWrapper::orderStatus**\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/order-status/introduction)changes, [**IBApi::EWrapper::openOrder**\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/open-orders)warnings, and **[IBApi::EWrapper::execDetails\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/execution-details/receive-execution-details)** to ensure proper operation.

If you experience issues with orders you place via the API, such as orders not filling, the first thing to check is what these callbacks returned. Your order may have been rejected or cancelled. If needed, see the **[API Log](/tws-api/doc/troubleshooting-support/log-files/location-of-interactive-brokers-logs)**section, for information on obtaining your API logs or submitting them for review.

Common cases of order rejections, cancellations, and warnings, and the corresponding message returned:

* If an order is subject to a large size (LGSZ) reject, the API client would receive **Error (201)** via **[IBApi::EWrapper::error\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/receiving-error-messages)**. The error text would indicate that order size too large and suggest another smaller size.
  + In accordance with our regulatory obligations as a broker, we cannot accept Large Limit Orders for #### shares of ABCD that you have submitted. Please submit a smaller order (not exceeding ###) *or convert your order to an algorithmic Order (IBALGO) [conditional on instrument]*

* If an order is subject to price checks the client may receive status (cancelled) + **Error (202)** via [**IBApi.EWrapper.orderStatus**\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/order-status/introduction) and **[IBApi::EWrapper::error\](/tws-api/doc/error-handling/receiving-error-messages)**. The error text would indicate the price is too far from current price.
  + In accordance with our regulatory obligations as a broker, we cannot accept your order at the limit price ### you selected because it is too far through the market. Please submit your order using a limit price that is closer to the current market price ###

* The client may receive warning Text via **[IBApi::EWrapper::openOrder\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/open-orders)** indicating that the order could be subject to price capping.
  + If your order does not immediately execute, in accordance with our regulatory obligations as a broker we may, depending on market conditions, reject your order if the limit price of your order is more than allowed distance from the current reference price. This is designed to ensure that the price of your order is in line with an orderly market and reduce the impact your order has on the market. Please note that such rejection will result in you not receiving a fill.
  + ***[mktCapPrice\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/order-status/introduction)*** – If an order has been capped, this indicates the current capped price (returned to[**IBApi.EWrapper.orderStatus**\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/open-orders))

title: Pre-Borrow Shares For Shorting
---
The TWS API supports the ability to pre-borrow shares for shorting.

* See [here](About Pre-Borrows) for Pre-Borrow Eligibility
* See [here](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/pricing/other-fees.php#:~:text=Stock%20Loan-,Pre%2DBorrows,-Universal) for pricing details

To place a Pre-Borrow order, users must:

* Assign the contract's exchange to "PREBORROW"
* Assign the contract's security type to "SBL"
* Assign the order's orderType to "MKT"

title: Test Order Impact (WhatIf)
---
From the API it is possible to check how a specified trade execution is expected to change the account margin requirements for an account in real time. This is done by creating an Order object which has the IBApi.Order.WhatIf flag set to true. By default, the whatif boolean in Order has a false value, but if set to True in an Order object with is passed to [IBApi.EClient.placeOrder](/docs/tws-api/pages/tws-api-documentation/orders/place-order/#place-order), instead of sending the order to a destination the IB server it will undergo a credit check for the expected post-trade margin requirement. The estimated post-trade margin requirement is returned to the IBApi.OrderState object in the [EWrapper.openOrder\](/tws-api/doc/order-management/open-orders) callback..

This is equivalent to creating a order ticket in TWS, clicking "Preview", and viewing the information in the "Margin Impact" panel.

Apart from InitMarginChange, there are other supported variables. For details, please visit: [/tws-api/ref/introduction](/tws-api/ref/introduction)

Note:

It is not recommended for users to submit lots of what-if orders. When a user submits a what-if order for margin preview only, the request is sent to IB credit system for review. In some cases, if user(s) submit lots of what-if orders, the creditman is affected. There is no clear limitation about this what-if feature. However, if you want to use this what-if feature, please:

* keep the ratio: 10 order submissions: 1 what-if request
* do not overuse the what-if request (> 1 what-if request per minute)
* cancel the what-if order after margin review



---
title: Trigger Methods
---
The Trigger Method defined in the [IBApi.Order\](/tws-api/doc/orders/the-order-and-contract-objects) class specifies how simulated stop, stop-limit, and trailling stops, and conditional orders are triggered. Valid values are:

* 0 – The default method for instrument
* 1 – "Double bid/ask" function, where stop orders are triggered based on two consecutive bid or ask prices.
* 2 – "Last" function, where stop orders are triggered based on the last price
* 3 – "Double last" function
* 4 – Bid/ask function
* 7 – Last or bid/ask function
* 8 – Mid-point function

Below is a table which indicates whether a given secType is compatible with bid/ask-driven or last-driven trigger methods (method 7 only used in iBot alerts)

| secType | Bid/Ask-driven (1, 4, 8) | Last-driven (2, 3) | Default behavior | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| STK | yes | yes | Last | The double bid/ask is used for OTC stocks |
| CFD | yes | yes | Last |  |
| CFD – Index | yes | n/a | n/a | Ex IBUS500 |
| OPT | yes | yes | US OPT: Double bid/ask, Other: Last |  |
| FOP | yes | yes | Last |  |
| WAR | yes | yes | Last |  |
| IOPT | yes | yes | Last |  |
| FUT | yes | yes | Last |  |
| COMBO | yes | yes | Last |  |
| CASH | yes | n/a | Bid/ask |  |
| CMDTY | yes | n/a | Last |  |
| IND | n/a | yes | n/a | For conditions only |

**Important notes** :

* If an incompatible triggerMethod and secType are used in your API order, the order may never trigger.
* These trigger methods only apply to stop orders simulated by IB. If a stop-variant is handled natively, the trigger method specified is ignored. See our [Stop Orders](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=609) page for more information.

Display Groups function allows API clients to integrate with [TWS Color Grouping Windows](https://www.ibkrguides.com/tws/usersguidebook/specializedorderentry/use_windows_grouping_to_link_blotter.htm).

TWS Color Grouping Windows are identified by a colored chain in TWS and by an integer number via the API. Currently that number ranges from 1 to 7 and are mapped to specific colors, as indicated in TWS.



---
title: Introduction
---
The IBApi.EClient.queryDisplayGroups method is used to request all available Display Groups in TWS. The IBApi.EWrapper.displayGroupList is a one-time response to IBApi.EClient.queryDisplayGroups.

It returns a list of integers representing visible Group ID separated by the "|" character, and sorted by most used group first. This list will not change during TWS session. In other words, user cannot add a new group, but only the sorting of the group numbers can change.

Example: "4|1|2|5|3|6|7"

Calendar and Event data can be retrieved from the Wall Street Horizon Event Calendar and accessed via the TWS API through the functions IBApi.EClient.reqWshMetaData and IBApi.EClient.reqWshEventData.

It is necessary to have the **Wall Street Horizon Corporate Event Data** research subscription activated first in [Account Management](https://www.ibkrguides.com/clientportal/usersettings/marketdatasubscriptions.htm).

WSH provides IBKR with corporate event datasets, including earnings dates, dividend dates, options expiration dates, splits, spinoffs and a wide variety of investor-related conferences.

The function IBApi.EClient.reqWshMetaData is used to request available event types, or supported filter values, that may be used in the call for [EClient.reqWshEventData()\](/tws-api/doc/wall-street-horizon/event-data/wsh-event-data-object) filter field.

Regardless of whether or not you are aware of the Meta Data filters, this request must **always** be called once per session prior to the [EClient.reqWshEventData()\](/tws-api/doc/wall-street-horizon/event-data/wsh-event-data-object) function.



---
title: Meta Data Filters
---
While this list contains an array of Meta Data filters that may be used, please be aware that new values may be made available or removed without notice.

In addition to the EClient.reqWshMetaData field being mandatory prior to the [EClient.reqWshEventData()\](/tws-api/doc/wall-street-horizon/event-data/wsh-event-data-object) function, the JSON content will also return the appropriate column values that are returned along with the function.

The function EClient.reqWshEventData is used to request various calendar events from Wall Street Horizon. The event data is then received via the callback EWrapper.wshEventData. Pending event data requests can be canceled with the function IBApi.EClient.cancelWshEventData.

**Note:** Prior to sending this message, the API client must make a request for metadata via [EClient.reqWshMetaData](#meta-data).

Also note that TWS will not support multiple concurrent requests. Previous request should succeed, fail, or be cancelled by client before next one. TWS will reject such requests with text "Duplicate WSH meta-data request" or "Duplicate WSH event request".



---
title: WshEventData Object
---
When making a request to the Wall Street Horizons Event Calendar with the API, users must create a wshEventData Object. This object contains several fields, along with a filter field, which takes a json-formatted string. The filter values are returned from WSH Meta Data requests.

When creating the object, users are able to specify either the WshEventData.conId, WshEventData.startDate, and WshEventData.endDate, or they may choose to use the WshEventData.filter value. Attempting to use both will result in an error.

Only one Event Type tag may be passed per request. Multiple submitted filters will be ignored beyond the final request.

#### WshEventData()

**conId:** String. Specify the contract identifier for the event request.

**startDate:** String. Specify the start date of the event requests. Formatted as "YYYYMMDD"

**endDate:** String. Specify the end date of the event requests. Formatted as "YYYYMMDD"

**fillCompetitors:** bool. Automatically fill in competitor values of existing positions.

**fillPortfolio:** bool. Automatically fill in portfolio values.

**fillWatchlist:** bool. Automatically fill in watchlist values.

**totalLimit:** int. Maximum of 100.

**filter:** String. Json-formatted string containing all filter values. Some available values include:

* watchlist: Array of string. Takes a single conid.
* country: String. Specify a country code, or "All".
* [EClient.reqWshMetaData()\](/tws-api/doc/wall-street-horizon/meta-data/meta-data-filters) responses will include an Event Type tag which can be used to filter the Event Data's response. The Json field is a boolean that can only take true to filter the given value
